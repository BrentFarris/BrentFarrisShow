00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
welcome back today we're one step closer to Microsoft buying blizzard

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
some new sea stuff I got a PHP note uh we got there's a lot of stuff about

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
programmer health and some other stuff to go over today so I guess the the first big story that

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
happened today was Microsoft is one step closer to buying blizzard of course this is all part of the

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
industry consolidation that everyone's talked about for the game industry and it's

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
part of uh I think it's it's it's related to something I mentioned before which is

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
we have an issue where a lot of stuff there's just a lot of games being

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
published out to steam and app stores on both IOS and Android and a lot now even

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
on the Nintendo switch which used to be a really walled off garden garden and with all that noise it's really hard

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
for people to punch through it and become successful a lot of them have to go through

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
YouTubers and YouTubers have a very specific show to put on so a lot of

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
games are being kind of developed in a way that YouTubers can can use them to be funny

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
or entertaining and so we've got a lot of noise in that at respect

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
there's a lot of games that are getting published with unity assets store stuff they just pull some stuff off the asset

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
store they pay a few bucks for throw it all together do some very light coding

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and then they put out a game in in less than a week and sometimes they're really successful on on YouTube there's a lot

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
of channels out there constantly looking for more content and games to play that are

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
different and so that constant stream is really nice that being said that makes for a lot of

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
noise in the game industry lots and lots of noise on all platforms we have a lot

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:61,000
of adult games coming out of nowhere in my my wife complains a lot about how

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
many adult games she's getting on Steam even though she has so many filters to block them they keep coming through I

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
think it's kind of the joke now everybody kind of sees that so with all that Madness

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
big companies they have the money to push their games to push their products

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
they they can Market to millions of people they have hundreds of millions of dollars to put into marketing and

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
research and influencer campaigns lots of influencer campaigns a lot of streamers are paid to

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
pay those the games to uh to promote them and uh sometimes I I don't even I don't

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
know if the streamers even mentioned that they are um paid to promote them and if they do it's probably at the beginning of the

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Stream and a lot of people aren't there for that so they just think that the streamer is like playing this game that they really just found and enjoyed when

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
those streamers are paid a ton of money to stream and I know this because I've worked with companies that do those

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
kinds of campaigns and they're a valid marketing campaign because you can get a lot of uh people to play your game using

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
this technique so how does that relate to Microsoft buying blizzard and consolidating of the

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
game industry well like I said in some previous videos people these companies are able to spend

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
millions and millions of dollars to get eyeballs in their games to buy their games and they make tons of money and

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
all the little companies that can't compete with that wealth have a very hard time even with really

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
incredible games there's a lot of incredible games that just nobody ever hears of or that never can get completed

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
because they can't get the funding and um so these big companies get bigger

37
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
they spend a lot of money to make a lot of money and then they spend that money to buy up all the other medium-sized

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
businesses I think every every company I've worked at for the last three companies

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:61,000
all three of them were purchased by a much larger company and one of them got purchased twice by a large company so

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
it's a it's a very real thing the consolidation of all these companies so the European commission has approved

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Microsoft's blizzard purchase um some some other European country I

42
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
don't know what it was probably England or something denied it but there's the I don't know

43
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
how this works but it still goes through and they're still going to be working towards it I am frankly a little bit

44
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
ambivalent to big companies buying up other big companies or big companies buying up no uh medium-sized companies

45
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
it's a great way for developers if they get equity in the middle a medium-sized company it's a great way to get an extra

46
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
paycheck and it's kind of just the way the system is what can we do we can't tell people to stop developing indie

47
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
games or we can't make them promise that they'll spend more than a week on an indie game before they publish it to

48
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
steam or any other game store so

49
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
just getting past that noise is already a high bar even if you do a Kickstarter

50
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
campaign a lot of the times your game has to be some kind of meme to to just to stand out and punch through all that

51
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
noise and um that could be frustrating for people who don't want to make meme games they want to make games that maybe

52
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
tell a story that means something to them or make a game that that's a story for children or or they want to make a

53
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
game that's uh you know more puzzle related but there's no gimmick and it's just a bunch of series of different

54
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
kinds of puzzles that sort of stuff and those Developers are basically developing games for

55
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
themselves and their friends because it's a hard Market to compete with

56
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
um I'm like I said I'm ambivalent to big companies buying up other big companies I think the consolidation just happens

57
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
maybe it'll lead to some kind of Tipping Point where um

58
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:60,000
people get tired of it maybe you know developers will get tired of making stuff of course

59
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
then we get into the whole AI stuff and then putting AI into games for really quick and easy content so I don't know

60
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
it could be noisy forever or I don't know maybe we can band together all of us game developers who spend a good

61
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
quality amount of time on our games there's a lot of us so if we got together and you know bought

62
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
and sold each other's games and uh it kind of collaborated in that way to create our own kind of

63
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
um group marketing strategy in that way maybe that's the way we can punch through with great game ideas and uh

64
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
stop leaving it just to the big guys to get to to be able to get their their games out there

65
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
so beyond uh this kind of business news

66
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
um the next thing I want to talk about is C C is my is a favorite link is my

67
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:60,000
favorite language um I love C plus plus I love C sharp I love JavaScript python I'm okay with I'm

68
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
learning I mean I'm learning the python variant and Godot and I've used python for

69
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
over a decade now um it's not one of my favorites but mainly because the whole tabbing thing

70
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
in spacing and all that sort of stuff but it's it's a lot different than it

71
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
was back then so I give you some credit anyways back to C uh we got some great news for some sea

72
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
people GCC 13 now supports c2x stuff

73
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
um and some of the notable things that people like to point out is uh null pointer which comes from C plus plus

74
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
that one I'm iffy about doesn't really matter to me I'm fine with null

75
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
um this null pointer makes it a little bit more explicit better compiler support that sort of stuff it's not just

76
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
a macro that evaluates to zero so that that'll allow some better compiler checking for things like that

77
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
um enhanced enums oh also for null pointer that not only for compilers

78
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
but kind of uh what are they called a static analysis tools we'll have

79
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
you know they won't have to deal with evaluating macros by name to figure out what the context is of that people are

80
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
doing so there are some benefits there for the the static analysis and the compilers enhanced enumerations

81
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
um if you've used enum you know that it evaluates to an INT an INT on a 16 uh on a 16-bit system is

82
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
going to be different than a 32 32 and 64 basically the same and evaluates the

83
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
32 bits but it's ambiguous right that's why we have stdent.h which allows us to use very

84
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
specific sizes for our integers like n32t unit 32d and all that sort of stuff

85
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
so the enhanced enumerations if I recall correctly allow you to put a colon and

86
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
then put the the size of the enum you see this a lot like an Unreal Engine whenever they're doing enums

87
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
um it's not like in C plus plus the the class enum stuff this is just allowing

88
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
uh enums to be a little bit safer in that way and adhere to a proper ABI

89
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
because if you put an enum instead of a struct and you compile it on two different systems you can't guarantee or

90
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
two different pilers even you can't guarantee that you're going to wind up with the exact same ABI especially

91
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
across the network if you're talking to like some super small embedded device you want your ABI especially in C to be

92
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
consistent so enhanced enumerations will help a lot with that another thing that I think my

93
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
friend a good friend of mine he really really wants from C plus plus which is the auto keyword now you may know that c

94
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
plus hijacked the auto keyword Auto comes from B which comes before c Dennis

95
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Ritchie worked on uh when he worked with B he wanted you know see he's supposed to

96
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
be somewhat backwards compatible I don't know a whole lot about B but uh the auto keyword came from that and I was for I

97
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
think locally scoped variables or or maybe something like that and it just got deprecated and unused over time so

98
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
the auto keyword you'll notice is a keyword in C and um now they're deciding you know Auto

99
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
bring Auto in and detect types of course you really need that in C plus because some of those types with the namespaces

100
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
and everything else the namespaces plus the long class names plus the uh you

101
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
know the templating make just just declaring the type of a variable

102
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:60,000
alone takes up the full 80 columns for people like me who like to call who like

103
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
to code in 80 columns you know you're going to wind up with like 120 minimum just to Define your variable not even

104
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
assign it so Otto is super necessary in my opinion for C plus plus not as necessary in C

105
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
but is nice um for when you just you just want to Auto it in and you don't want to have to

106
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
worry about it uh I don't I don't change type names that often if I do I use a refactoring tool so I'm not crazy I'm

107
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
not like banging down the door to get Auto in another one is const expression now I

108
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
know you see plus plus guys you know what const Discretions are they're a great tool for the compiler we are not

109
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
talking about the same const expression this is like a lightweight version of constant expression which does allow

110
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
some compile time stuff it's it's been months since I read the spec on constant expression for C so I I don't recall it

111
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
off all off the top of my head but go check it out it's the it's kind of like a nice little addition

112
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
again see it's supposed to be lightweight and I can take or leave any of these I can code in c99 but I do like

113
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
to stay up to date and see and mess around with like the generic macro or or you know some of the modern Atomic stuff

114
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
and things like that it is nice to to stay kind of up to date with

115
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
with computers and just what CPUs and all the CPUs and gpus are doing these

116
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
days so it's good to stay up to date that's what's happening in Sea land now

117
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm going to take a second to talk about PHP for you web people who still use PHP

118
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I don't I I love PHP because it's so simple I use node.js for websites too I

119
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
use things like Firebase for a random website every now and then to throw it up um you know I I but I do love PHP

120
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
because it's very flat straightforward simple and it's well supported on basically everything like coding on

121
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Windows is pretty easy debugging in all windows and all that at least since I've

122
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
been doing it for a while maybe I'm cheating because I've used it for many years but php8 came out a while ago and now I

123
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
have a little bit of a rant for people who are using PHP and not using php8 I I

124
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
love PHP and I love the flexibility of it so I get it you want to use kind of

125
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
the old Trend true but please uh try out php8 and especially try out the uh what

126
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
do they call type names being able to type name and uh

127
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
kind of strongly type your PHP is very nice and it's great because it's not all or nothing you can use some strong types

128
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
or you should use strong types in many places where um you know what the type is going to be

129
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
and then you can just not use strong types and places that you want to deal with you know strings or network

130
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
requests or things coming up you know from a client or going to the client or just the arbitrary data like you know

131
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
collections or an array of you know if you want to make an array with mixed

132
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
data types inside of them that's completely fine but trial php8 and do

133
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
use the type the type name syntax the reason I bring this up is because I

134
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
don't see I see I continue to see PHP being used in the modern era and all of them are

135
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
like I've even seen stuff on php5 which I used like a decade ago so php7 is pretty

136
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
popular but try out php8 get up to date it's faster type type safety whenever you add type

137
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
names you automatically get some magical speed up in your code just because it's

138
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:60,000
known anytime you have something known your code's going to go faster this is this is why native code like C and C

139
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
plus plus are so fast other than them not having garbage collectors or being

140
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
interpreted everything you want you try to make everything known and like you duplicate

141
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
functions that's what templates do they just duplicate the functions for different types and everything is just

142
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
statically known and so it could be really fast because it knows what it's doing it knows the size of variables

143
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
that are going inside of functions it doesn't have to dynamically allocate the stack so

144
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
just a little aside and assembly whenever you compile C or C

145
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
plus plus there's a thing called a shadow stack and there's also home space these this is a space when you call a

146
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
function it has to allocate it uses some registers for the first few arguments but then it has to allocate the stack

147
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
some memory on the stack to be able to know the size of the arguments going in if the size is arbitrary and jumping

148
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:61,000
around all the time it's going to have to determine the size before it can allocate that X that stack space or it's

149
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
going to over allocate the stack space just to uh just to to support some unknown type so

150
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
uh it it's yeah type type safety is also good just FYI for all of you PHP

151
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
programmers out there give it a try I promise you'll love it I love it and I

152
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I still keep the flexibility and simplicity of PHP I can write a whole routing I can write an entire

153
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
router um you know for a request that comes in I can take the URL and figure out which

154
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
uh like get or post request or even to to return um you know some content with in like 30

155
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
less than 30 lines of code I can write a PHP router so and that's using all the PHP stuff so

156
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
give it a try the next thing that I want to talk about is programmers

157
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
uh Mental Health I saw a lot of news articles recently about programmers with mental health uh

158
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
not issues but like they're burnt out or you know they stopped coding for a while and they're coming back or they just you

159
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
know they can't seem to keep a job or get a job the job Market's

160
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
hard right now I'm not looking for a job so I I don't know about it I know

161
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
there's been tons and tons of layoffs recently um I don't know how many of those are

162
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
programmers but I'm I'm certain there's got to be quite a few programmers within there and probably a lot of web

163
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
programmers and just because I think they got overstaffed during you know

164
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
the the stuff that went on in 2020 2019 that's all that stuff so they kind of

165
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
overstaffed and uh you know now it's hard to find work apparently for some people

166
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:61,000
um yeah if you're getting burnout for programming

167
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
um I don't want to tell you take take a break I don't know uh maybe you're not

168
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
coding what you love coding I have coded almost Non-Stop

169
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
no breaks for nearly 15 years uh hours and hours a day every day I

170
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
still have a wife I still have kids I I still have a job I still do random stuff

171
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
on the side like this thing and um you know I still could I love code I

172
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
sat here and read articles about code so if you're getting burned out maybe you're not focusing on what matters most

173
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
to you maybe you're chasing after Trends maybe you're you're you know not you're

174
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
trying too hard to complete projects that you're not interested anymore I think the key to my success in

175
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
continuing to code and not get burned out is that I just whenever I finish coding a part

176
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
of some big Grand idea that I've had I just quit programming and I'm done and I move it on I move on to something else

177
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
it's it's not that important to finish the project and you know what you don't always have to be the guy you don't have to go make

178
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
a million dollars you don't have to be super you know uh you don't have to make some super cool project that everyone

179
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
uses or anything like that you don't have to be the guy give yourself some slack have fun coding is fun most of it

180
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
is creative and playing around with different ideas it's all just a game it's a it's a puzzle that you play

181
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
around with and have fun with and that's the key and that's also why I've programmed in

182
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
so many languages I have dealt with so many different Technologies and also program stuff for like Game Boy

183
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
and I've tried out and learned like four different assembly languages I just have

184
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
fun it's just a puzzle to me so don't burn yourself out if you're being burned out it's probably because you're

185
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
doing something you don't want to do um the there's uh yeah this this guy here

186
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
um not gonna show it I don't want to point out anybody specific but you know he's saying that he's having a hard time

187
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
with the job market but he seems a really like blase like super chill and like you know get coffee

188
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
and chill sip on some tea a very it looks like uh he mentioned the

189
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
only reason I know he's a coder is because he mentioned it there's like a one sentence where it was mentioned in

190
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
this whole thing um so maybe if you talk more about code and uh update your LinkedIn do some

191
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
things like that I I'm not too fond of his advice advice is just like if you're doing front end do back end

192
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
um if you're like I don't know stuff about self-care and stuff like that look if you want a job

193
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
in Co and programming I'll tell you the secret program a lot impress people do some

194
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
math for fun make a whole bunch of websites make some games uh update your LinkedIn recruiters are always looking

195
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
on LinkedIn put a whole bunch of keywords of everything you've you've done so you'll see in the first episode

196
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
of the podcast where I read off a bunch of stuff that I have messed with that list and more is on my LinkedIn and

197
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
um I'm you know recruiters they look up these keywords and that's how they find people so update your

198
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
LinkedIn put in all the keywords of the stuff that you know how to do because you will be tested on them if you uh go

199
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
for a job interview don't waste anybody's time not knowing how to do something um

200
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
that being said my first job when I barely started coding in PHP ibsed it

201
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
and said I knew exactly what I was doing and the guy the owner had me come out to the back and he's like look here's my

202
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
problem with the code and he left me with it and I had to figure it out in 30 minutes and it was just it was a serious

203
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
problem they had with their company and this was a small company and I figured it out in 30 minutes and I blew my own

204
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:61,000
mind and here's he hired me on the spot because he was so excited that I solved it so sometimes that scenario can work

205
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
but don't rely on it don't don't take my advice on that

206
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
um there's been also one other thing related to health and programming

207
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
is uh people have been talking about software development ethics

208
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
now I have a very specific view on ethics in programming

209
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
um if it's a game and it doesn't hurt anybody and you don't steal anybody's stuff and you don't take their money and

210
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
all this sort of stuff you know if you if you're if you buy a product and you own it for example

211
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
um like if you buy a a game a modern game even and you tear it apart to

212
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
figure out what's going on inside of it and you learn their company secrets that way

213
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
that's fine in my opinion that's you exploring and researching um that's not the ethics I'm talking

214
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
about here I think their ethics is more about their focus is kind of on artificial

215
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
intelligence and it it talks about uh you know using AI to steal stuff or scam

216
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
people all that sort of stuff I don't think I don't think we're gonna

217
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
change anybody's mind on programming ethics um you're just going to code the way

218
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
that you code if you're going to get more ethical in programming you need to be more

219
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
ethical as a person and I don't mean to make this less technical to talk but

220
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
the the problems at the source uh you know that's the same truth and code

221
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
as it is with people so if if you find that you're talking to somebody or knows

222
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
somebody that has um you know they're doing nasty things and

223
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
stealing people's info and trying to scam them you're not gonna you're not gonna change their mind by writing a

224
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
blog post about programming ethics and trying to get out there and teach programming ethics to groups of people

225
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I've seen it on LinkedIn I've seen it in blog posts I've seen it kind of it's like I don't know if people are just

226
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
trying to become speakers at some kind of event or something but ethics are at the source and the

227
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
people have to change their own internal ethics they have to be willing not to steal from people they have to be willing not to lie they have to be

228
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
willing to have integrity in and not run up the clock for their employer doing nothing a lot of programmers don't do as

229
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
much as they should when uh when they're at work or when they're on teams I have a

230
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I have a little story about when I was in college um there was this there's I would always

231
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
be on teams in college and I was the one even though I went to school for animation I was the one who was doing

232
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
the code stuff and I wound up doing all the code and the coders just didn't uh

233
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
they didn't do their their work of course I was a coder at the same time because I was more focused on like on

234
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
code at that point but I wound up doing all the work and they didn't do anything and you know that's

235
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
not their own software development ethics that's their own personal ethics they were more interesting one of them

236
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
was more interested in looking at opengl and making a cube move or something

237
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
um that's that's just people ethics you can't you can't preach software software ethics to people you gotta teach if you

238
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
want to preach ethics you got to preach people ethics treat people nicely you

239
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
know don't steal don't steal from your employer don't steal their time don't

240
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
steal their money don't steal from others respect others all these things this isn't this isn't a podcast about

241
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
morals but it uh you need to you need to preach morals to

242
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
people um not software ethic so um please don't

243
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
go to any of these software ethics talks I don't I don't know what they really have to talk about

244
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
um so yeah that's that's kind of the mental health aspect of

245
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
today's thing and uh yeah I just noticed there was a burst in

246
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
all these I mean it seems to be constant ever since 2019 lots of mental health and

247
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
kind of existential crises with programmers I don't know why programmers

248
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
have have this you know I I feel like I've been playing a game for 15 years so

249
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I had I I've I haven't really felt this but all I can say is what I've done and

250
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
hopefully that helps somebody out there um so I want to talk about now

251
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Google is one of those

252
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:61,000
um they're not part of I can I don't think I see a n n the domain name I don't know

253
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
what to call them the domain name uh Consortium or something like that but they are kind of they are associated to

254
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
it which means they can come up with domain names and one of the things that they

255
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
decided to come up with there I've even got the site here to to show you

256
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
one of the things that they came up with is here's the new domain names let me zoom

257
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
in on this okay dot Foo okay I feel like that's some kind of

258
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
programming joke Maybe okay that's fine um let's see what else we've got

259
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
dot zip now the uh

260
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
eagle-eyed viewer out there will know that dot zip is probably not a

261
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:61,000
good idea for a domain extension uh what are they called top level domain name or

262
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
something like that tldn or something dot zip is probably not a good idea you probably shouldn't use super well-known

263
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
extensions for your domain names and now this is the goofy part uh ZIP this is their

264
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
definition this is what they told icann and these are approved I believe

265
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
please note that the launch schedule for this is the this TLD has been modified since being announced the schedule is

266
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
published below and has been updated and approved by a icannn

267
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
zip is a secure domain name for typing for tying things together or moving

268
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
really fast hosting content on a dot zip domain means speed this is kind of like

269
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Zip and Zippy's Zip Zip Zip um so

270
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
maybe they didn't realize that's also for the compressed file type

271
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I feel like that's just problems waiting to happen like who first of all

272
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I would never make a domain name unless it's a joke as a dot zip because you'll

273
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
probably put it be put on all the spam lists and no one will probably click your link they'll think that you're

274
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
scamming them with a zip file that's already one problem and good on them too because I I can tell you that dot zip

275
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
domains will probably use be used to scam people a lot

276
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
you know free music dot zip and it'll download a zip file when you go to it

277
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
and then of course the kids or or whoever is downloading this um will then get a virus because they

278
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
went to this dot zip domain and I know it's not any different than

279
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
freemusic.com zip or slash whatever or if you meet freemusic.com and then get a

280
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
you know a zip file sent to you but if something downloads when you go to a

281
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
website you are probably questioning it even the kid would be like I didn't click on

282
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
anything but if you go to a dot zip domain and it downloads something that's a zip file you probably won't question

283
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
it as much I'm just saying the other one is dot mov

284
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
um let's see this is a secure domain for moving pictures and other things that

285
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
move for anything that moves you dot move is the perfect domain this is also a famous

286
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
file extension and if you download a mov file by going to

287
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I don't know pocahontas.mov and it downloads a movie called Pocahontas

288
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
and it's not really a movie file and something else then you

289
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
have another problem I love dot dad though that Dad is

290
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
is a secure domain for dads and I'm a dad I can get behind dot dad that's that's

291
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
awesome so I can't get behind.zip.mov but I can get behind.dad

292
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
um dot PhD dot Professor hopefully these uh

293
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
show off your teaching credentials um hopefully these are locked I don't know what uh if if any of these are

294
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
locked like dot edu and dot gov are locked you can't get them as an individual you have to prove that you're

295
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
a educational uh Institution for edu and you have to prove your government entity

296
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
for dot gov and that's why those are successful and you can use the edu for

297
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
you know getting discounts and stuff is because they can trust that those are locked I don't know if PhD and Professor

298
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
are locked nor do I care I don't think um

299
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I don't think certain people in society should just get and get special like individuals get

300
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
special privileges for domain extensions that seems a little weird

301
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
um especially when there's a lot of people with phds that aren't uh you know that study weird that study weird things

302
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
and they have a PhD and um or they they studied one thing and they start preaching about another and say they're

303
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
a doctor we have a lot of those on you know on the internet my wife shows me a

304
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
bunch of them uh just these people masquerading as actual scientists or

305
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
whatever and they're not so these are a little weird I can see these scamming people I can see these

306
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
scamming people with uh kind of just falsified stuff and even even so there

307
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
there are a lot of doctors and PhD people out there that kind of they don't have time to do the research

308
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
let's say they're a doctor and they're a surgeon they don't have time to research uh you know some some other field of

309
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Medical Science so they rely on others and so if someone sent them you know if they trust

310
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:61,000
someone and that person's email got hacked and they sent them a fake thing and then this other person started propagating it we shouldn't have like

311
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Authority domains outside of uh gov so I don't know what Esq is uh

312
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
show you are a bar admissions Almar work experience

313
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
lawyer okay um yeah so I'm not super down on lockdown

314
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
domains outside of edu and gov I think those were two good choices and the only two that I think should exist dot dad

315
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
that's the one that wins it I bet you I can saw this list and all they saw was dot dad was like yeah whatever I just

316
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
let it go we're getting dead there oh Nexus I skipped that one

317
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
um it's like a hub interesting yeah zip and mov are the ones I wanted to complain about and I

318
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
have complaint about them so Let's uh move on

319
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:60,000
so another topic that I've seen um fairly recently

320
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
is I mean it's I've seen it recently but I've seen it

321
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
essentially the whole time I've done web development and that's people trying to figure out

322
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
what database to use now a lot of these sites are going to be one versus the other so like graph

323
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
database versus a relational database or a nosql database versus a SQL

324
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
database I don't often see vertical databases in here or anything like that so our memory cache databases although

325
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
MySQL has memory cache it has you can set it up to have memory cache

326
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
as a storage mechanism so anyways the debate on which database to

327
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
use um really you should be using many different databases for the different

328
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
parts of your program that does different things with data so you'll use

329
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I think it's a really used like a redis for a leaderboard so that you can

330
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
quickly sort and select things you'll use a MySQL for long term concrete

331
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
storage you don't want messed up like accounts and you know keeping track of

332
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
very sensitive data like that you'll use nosql databases for game data and quick

333
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
storage of save data or or like where enemies kind of I don't know if you have

334
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
like timetables or something you can put those in there just kind of transient data that's not so important that's okay

335
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
to refill um and you'll use you know cache databases

336
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
for very quick lookups if especially this you you normally front cache like a

337
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
MySQL relational database you front cache it so that you can if something's

338
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
requested a lot from those structured databases you can get to that

339
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
information very quickly another one is uh what did I mention the graph

340
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
database so graph database is great for data that is highly intertwined think

341
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
friend graphs I think we've all seen that so you have a lot of you know data that's connected

342
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
to that's interconnected and it can have some Blobs of information you know like account name and login date and you know

343
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
friends and the friends is the graph or something like that so use a graph for that kind of data so

344
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
what I'm getting at is stop arguing over database types use them all they all

345
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
have a specific purpose for specific things there's not one that's going to be a Magic Bullet there's not one that's

346
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
going to solve all your problems I know that if you use things like Firebase or whatever they may only have

347
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:61,000
support a couple variants of databases which is bad but it does help with those

348
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
types of like live apps or whatever um you should use the database that you

349
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
need for the time you need it uh cool you know key value stores also I

350
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
know that no SQL is often a key value store but you can also just have a flat

351
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
like key and value whether it's a blob of binary data or whatever so just pick the database that works for

352
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
the task not the program not the whole app for the task

353
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
and you'll be happy that's one of the downsides of web development of your web developer you've got to use

354
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
different Technologies all the time from the language to the stack to the operating system to the web browser size

355
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
whether it's a phone or a desktop window or if the database doesn't matter you're

356
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
using different Tech all the time it's the curse of the job so

357
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
that's that's my view on all the arguments I constantly see over the

358
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
years of database selection so don't fall into which database is better use

359
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
the database that works for the specific type of data and is not unreasonable to use all the databases because you need

360
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
all those different types of data oh and now I can't uh I can't go on to

361
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
the fun stuff without talking about artificial intelligence uh it's all in the news so of course there's a lot of

362
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
news for it Google has you know they had Google I O just

363
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
recently that's the developer um as the developer conference for Google

364
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
however it's also part uh part them trying to

365
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
please the investors and also consumers because a lot of people were watching

366
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:61,000
Google I O that have never programmed in their life because they wanted to see the pixel fold I'm not here to talk

367
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
about the pixel fold I'm here to talk about the goofiness of responsible AI

368
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
all these people are praising this responsible Ai and I think that it's you

369
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
know it's good to have responsible AI however putting some metadata on a photo and embedding some data into a photo is

370
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
not responsible AI responsible AI comes from the source not the output so uh

371
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I I know that this is kind of one of the hot arguments on Art and that sort of stuff I'm not

372
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
here to talk about artificial intelligence reading people's art and stealing it or anything like that I I

373
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
have no strong opinions on that I love Ai and I also love art and I want to see

374
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
both of them flourish so one of the things that that felt goopy

375
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:60,000
goofy to me was the responsible AI stuff and if you know the um if you're in the United States you may

376
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
know that all the tech leaders except Elon Musk went to the White House to talk about artificial intelligence and

377
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
responsible artificial intelligence so you had like Satya Nadella Microsoft you had whoever was from Google I uh I think

378
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
the CEOs left and came back I can't remember the names very well and then of course all the other places probably

379
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
open Ai and all that it was there's a room full of uh you know tech people and the

380
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
president so they had this whole Meetup about responsible Ai and what does responsible

381
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
AI mean now it's always kind of goofy to have corporations and CEOs who are beholden

382
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
to their shareholders in those kinds of meetings to talk about their responsibilities to the human race at

383
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
large um but you know it is a good thing that

384
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:61,000
they talk about it and of course they get warnings and say hey we're going to regulate this thing

385
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
probably so stay in line uh

386
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
anyways the one thing that irked me about the AI thing Google I O was their big push on

387
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
uh detecting AI generated images the image thing really got me because

388
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
first of all metadata they're going to put metadata inside of images that's fantastic because you know what whenever

389
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
you upload an image to any website worth their grain their their weight and salt salt sugar worth their weight in gold

390
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
uh they strip meta tags So Meta is useless it just gets discarded by all companies

391
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
because well first they read it they read it for themselves they want to get your GPS location all that stuff that's

392
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
in your photo by the way turn off GPS on your photos nobody uses the photos where was I GPS

393
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
thing um on your phone uh you're just giving people your position

394
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
all the time it's kind of strange and who knows who can get access to that but anyways before they take that photo

395
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
and send it off and propagate it to everybody they completely strip meta tags just so that it does protect your

396
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
personal information because photos The Meta for photos can have a lot of stuff in there that shouldn't and also if

397
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
you're a web developer strip The Meta do not just take people's photos and host

398
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
them strip them out of there's there's a ton you can just take a photo if you're

399
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
doing node.js for example there's a library where you can just take the photo and when it takes the photo you

400
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
can have it as part of one of the arguments to just strip The Meta and if you don't know how to do meta

401
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
stripping or anything like that the easiest way to do it if you're kind of new to coding or you're not well versed

402
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:60,000
on how to access the metadata on a file if you take the photo and then use like

403
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Magics or whatever it's called just any kind of image library and just crop it

404
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
by like a you don't even I don't even think you have to change it at all but you probably should just so that you

405
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
know that it's working just like crop it or change something about it using the

406
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
photo editing software or photo editing the library

407
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
and then save it and that just strips The Meta automatically because it's saving a new image so strip The Meta

408
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
inside of the photos and videos please do not do not do not read it do not take

409
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
it do not sell it do not redistribute it strip The Meta so the second thing is

410
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
um and this is probably the more clever one but not exactly perfect that's where you can

411
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
encode data inside of an image without changing how the image looks so you can

412
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
inject data that's not metadata you know like you know into the interlaced into

413
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
the pixels or interlaced into the header or anything like that of the file

414
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
now that's obviously not something that gets stripped very easily but if you

415
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
open that photo inside of a photo editor and save it that's just going to be gone it's the it's not coded in the pixels I

416
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
mean even if it is encoded in the pixels it's just going to resave the pixels in a new way when you export from a photo

417
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
program so it's like the easiest thing to get rid of so even if you use that Library example where you just take it

418
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
and crop it or whatever and then save it again that little encoded data that was in there is now gone because it got

419
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
re-saved maybe has a different format or a format doesn't that doesn't support interlaced data inside of the pixels

420
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
so that's my rant on on that that was just lip service the the photo stuff just pure lip service by Google on on

421
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
trying to make people think that they're thinking about ethical Ai and in fact in my opinion that's a complete waste of

422
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
money you shouldn't be putting you know that in fact that

423
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
doesn't even cost them that much money to put that in you know on the output of the image instead of investing money in

424
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
ethical AI put and the file that gets outputted you need to invest ethical AI in the input

425
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
how you train the system what you do with the system that's ethical that is

426
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
two different arguments so don't believe the hype on when people talk about encoding will

427
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
tell you if it's a if it's a AI inside of the image or AI generated in the

428
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
image it's nonsense invest in a in a service where I can upload a picture to Google and it

429
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
has a memory of all the photos it generated so it can tell me if that photo was generated by AI that right

430
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
there doesn't need metadata it doesn't need to put little tags inside of the binary that just me send you it and you

431
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
tell me whether it is just do that that's that's probably way more useful and then just make that an API I can

432
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
call so I guess that was kind of a rant on ethical AI so we're going to talk about

433
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
some fun stuff now I've seen in in uh like programming humor stuff

434
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
a lot of people are fighting over text editors this is funny to me because uh we have people saying I

435
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
use notepad and of course we all use notepad to do some code but they're all

436
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
ragging on Visual Studio code I don't know why probably because Visual Studio code came out and it became really

437
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
popular because it's node.js you can host it on the web you can has all kinds of easy plugins you can use web

438
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
technology to write your plugins and I've written like language servers and

439
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
stuff like that and for visual studio code it's nice uh but you have all kinds of people

440
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
talking about notepad or atom or my text editor runs inside of a terminal uh

441
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Visual Studio code doesn't uh my text editor runs a web page within it and all

442
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
this other stuff so that's a lot of fun go into programming humor and please post some more text text

443
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
editor uh jokes because I love them they're funny

444
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
to me I think nobody's taking it seriously of course there are people out there that are dyards on their text

445
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
editors I can use anything I can use notepad I use c-line I use Visual Studio I use Visual Studio code I use Nano I

446
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
sometimes use them I use web div editable divs doesn't matter to

447
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
me text this text whatever as long as I can press Tab and I get a tab

448
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
that's all I need but those are kind of funny so uh here's

449
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
here's a I have an example here of one um this is just one I I saw like seven

450
00:47:59,000 --> 00:47:61,000
of these I think there's a thing going on right now where everyone's doing them but go contributes these

451
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
and now I'm going to uh and talk about I I don't know anything about

452
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
this indie game or anything else I just know it looked kind of fun um so I thought I'd share it just

453
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
because I I kind of want to talk about indie games every now and then that uh piqued my interest it may be a copy of

454
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
another indie game and maybe a clone like maybe a stolen idea or whatever the

455
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
concept is uh pretty fun I'm actually going to turn off as some music I don't know if it's

456
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
copyright but but the idea is that you have these little paddles on the bottom

457
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
and you gotta slap the boxes that are coming down and as you rotate them the

458
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
the paddles on the bottom sticks in place so see you have the blue one on the right now it can wind up all the way

459
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
on the left and I thought that was kind of a neat little puzzle game I love puzzle games um I love first person shooters puzzle

460
00:48:59,000 --> 00:48:61,000
games RTS I love all kinds of games so um I thought this one was kind of fun I so I I kind of wanted to shout out

461
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
um whatever game this is It's called swap I guess uh pretty neat idea it's fun it's

462
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
simple um hopefully it's not just going to be a mobile game hopefully there's going to

463
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
be more to it I'm not super into mobile games but it does have IOS and Android here

464
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
um and it's coming on Steam so I don't know if you're a developer head add some cool uh some some cool

465
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
desktop perks um don't don't make your game lock down

466
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
lock down don't lock down its potential to mobile devices um and that's that's kind of another

467
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
thing I guess I'll end on is if you're going to make a game

468
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
and you're gonna put it on different devices uh one of the things that I don't like

469
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
for example is old games like I don't know Grand Theft Auto Vice City or something coming to

470
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
mobile because the controls are clunky and I don't I I didn't buy it because I

471
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
didn't want to play it on phone I've I have copies of you know I have copies of

472
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Vice City on Xbox and Playstation 2 I think it is over there somewhere so I I'm not I didn't spend any money on

473
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
it but I doubt it has good Bluetooth controller support um a lot of games on mobile don't

474
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
so if you put your game on Steam or whatever make some controller support on mobile put in the extra effort I know it

475
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
kind of sucks but let's make mobile games better by adding more support controls now let's

476
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
let's add a whole realm let's Force Google and apple to to have a little tag

477
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
on there that says you know controller required or something like that let's just make a whole category for it that'd

478
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
be fantastic I would love that but anyways yeah that was a cool little indie game called swap don't know much

479
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
more than that video that's all I've seen so uh that's that's about it thanks

480
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
for thanks for listening and I'll see you guys in the next one bye for now
