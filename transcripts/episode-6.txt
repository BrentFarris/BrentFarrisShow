all right welcome back today we've got a few news stories we're going to talk about Google Chrome both with misspelled
0:06
URLs third-party cookies we're going to talk about how you shouldn't feel so bad about not
0:12
finishing projects I'm going to talk about augmented reality I love augmented reality chat GPT has an iOS app.net for
0:18
previews here and just general just general text stuff it's going to be
0:24
exciting hopefully I can sync up my audio right this time I think I've had some issues in the past but we shall see
ChatGPT on iOS
0:32
chat GPT it's out on iOS I don't know if you heard about it everybody's talking about it there's tons of people tweeting
0:39
about it and articles being made it's this big old hubbub I don't have an
0:44
iPhone uh it's not on Android and well
0:49
my wife has an iPhone so for those of you who don't have an iPhone and have an
0:54
Android like me or just not even a smartphone at all maybe you have a dumb phone a Linux phone who knows
1:01
I'm going to spoil it for you you launch the app it asks you for your date of
1:07
birth and then it asks you for your phone number now the date of birth thing
1:14
might be some requirement by Apple for artificial intelligence stuff blah blah blah the phone number thing is annoying
1:21
I already have a an account with with open AI I use their apis for just random
1:29
toy projects of my own nothing nothing public but
1:35
the iOS version of chat chip is it's basically just the web version except
1:41
harder to use I think that's the easiest way to explain it I guess it's in your pocket and it's on
1:47
your phone so it's easier for people who don't have desktops or laptops or anything that's of that nature
1:54
there is a voice input button you press that and a big old voice thing pops up
2:00
it's not Siri it's just a big old voice thing it's probably their whisper or
2:05
whatever whatever their API is called for voice to text
2:11
so you press that you talk into it you press it again the it the big old Circle
2:16
that it makes and it just puts the text in the input box doesn't even send it so
2:21
I don't see the difference between typing with voice to text normally with Siri versus pressing that other than that one
2:28
maybe is more accurate I don't know uh I didn't exactly
2:35
over test this thing so I checked that out that was underwhelming and then you can normally type in text and then it'll
2:41
respond it does respond pretty quick my wife she typed in the prompt or she
2:48
talked in the prompt to hit send and it was almost immediate that it responded which is a little faster than just a
2:54
normal question on the web version so maybe there's that browse through the
3:00
settings I kind of looked around the app it's very Bare Bones it's mostly just
3:07
chat GPD where you get to talk to chat GPT so it really doesn't seem any
3:12
different from the web version so if you're on Android you're not missing out on anything if you just open up the web
3:18
version of chat gbt that's essentially what it is except in the web version
3:24
if you use the web version on your desktop you are familiar with the UI scheme and where things are so I guess
3:31
there's a perk there but yeah I was I was a little interested in what was going to go on with the chat
3:37
GPT iOS and a little disappointed it would have been at least it would have
3:43
been cool if you could have a conversation back and forth you talk to it it talks back to you you didn't have
3:49
to press send every time you use their voice to text a little extra features like that would have went a long way so
3:56
in my opinion the Bing chat GPT
4:01
is better on phones you can talk to it and it talks back with references and
4:07
all this other sort of nonsense that you maybe or may not want and you can set as temperament so
4:14
if you really want an app to use on your phone to talk to http or type to it I
4:19
would use the Bing chat one just in general now if you like chat GPT for like
4:24
storytelling and long longer form conversations so it doesn't cut you off of course you're not going to get that
4:31
with the bing one the bing one Cuts you off pretty quick as soon as it starts to notice it's building up a temper so
4:37
that's that's what the chat GPT official
4:42
IOS app is a little underwhelming oh well it's what we got
Google Chrome corrects URLs
4:48
in a smaller amount of news that not many people may have heard of yet is
4:55
that Google Chrome is going to be detecting typos inside of the URL box
5:00
and it says that it will make suggestions of what it thought you meant
5:08
now I think this can be abused where you could go to type in something and it's
5:14
going to overly be aggressive and suggest you things
5:20
that are Google services or Google Affiliated services or websites that highly integrate with Google and make a
5:26
lot of Google ad Revenue so I think there is room for it to be abused however in principle The Very base
5:34
concept of detecting a URL
5:40
mistype and suggesting you a correction I think is a good idea
5:46
why do I think it's a good idea it's because I don't spell things good I
5:51
sometimes I I type like a normal person or I type in the standard way I should
5:58
say you know index fingers on the F and the J and thumbs on the space bar all that nonsense
6:04
so even though I do that I wind up tripping up or missing a key or my
6:10
fingers going in a way where I just I try to hit a number for example and I
6:15
hit the wrong number and things get a little offset it's very rare but it happens enough for me to worry about it
6:23
so often what I do is rather than typing in direct URL
6:28
say some specific website I will
6:33
even if I've typed it a thousand times even if it auto fills it and says this is the one that you're likely going to
6:39
do because you did it previously I still will type it in as a search
6:45
query and when I do a search query I have I have the ability to select the link
6:53
that I want I can just click on it and that makes me feel a little more secure in what I'm typing so it's become a
7:00
habit of mine to just search for for whatever site I'm going to now if
7:07
it's a simple site that I've used a million times say like a YouTube or Twitter or or whatever have you or my
7:14
own sites that I've set up I'm not likely going to do that kind of roundabout effort but if it's a site I
7:21
use occasionally like bills or things of that nature where I
7:29
may check it every month or or I may go to it a few times a week or something like that not bills but you know just
7:36
general stuff then I will type it in to a search box and then click on the link rather than
7:42
typing it out because the last thing I want to do is for that tiny little text at the top of the URL
7:48
on a distance screen for me for me to put an L instead of an i or something and hit enter
7:55
and it takes me to some phishing site which is cloned whatever website they know I'm trying to go to
8:00
and so you know call me a little bit uh of a worrywart in that way but
8:09
it makes sure that I don't mess up and do something that I'm going to regret because those people they'll they'll
8:16
steal your whole life away if you if you let them so I think the general concept of
8:23
when you type something a URL bar it gives you suggestions I think it's a fantastic idea I wish other browsers uh
8:31
like Brave or DuckDuckGo or whatever Firefox I I wish they would all do it
8:38
but that they would suggest meaningful sites I can see that Google
8:45
does have an incentive they don't just make features especially ones as low-key as this
8:51
uh for free so of course they're going to use it for some sort of advertising or or pushing certain types of products
8:58
over others which is going to be annoying but the base ideas there and I think that everything should adopt it I
9:04
think it's a great way to solve a problem and put my mind to ease I don't
9:09
know if I'll Trust it to start but maybe it'll get me over my habit of having to
9:15
search for sites and go based off of search engines so we'll we'll find out
Augmented reality
9:20
on that augmented reality it's it's a specific type of virtual reality
9:28
that I enjoy more than virtual reality so you'll find people who are in the
9:34
augmented reality camp and really want to be in that space and then you'll find the people in the virtual reality camp
9:40
and really want to be in that space now of course people could be interested in both however you usually have people who
9:49
are weighted more towards one than the other for me it's augmented reality I really love the idea of augmented
9:55
reality having the space around you and being in the real world and augmenting it
10:01
that's awesome that's something straight out of you know iRobot or or Minority
10:06
Report or whatever you know all those those cool Sci-Fi movies so being able
10:11
to put a video and pin it to a wall and just like walk around and have it stuck to that wall where you left it
10:18
and place things and pin them to the world is I don't know it's just kind of a really neat concept to me virtual
10:25
reality kind of absorbs your senses and that it puts you
10:30
into a 3D World so it it's fun and and all that but it really isn't something
10:36
you could do for all day I can see augmented reality in some ways be an
10:42
all-day thing for work or or whatever something that just because you're still part of the real world you're just
10:47
putting things around in it and that I think is where the appeal is for
10:53
me now the one problem I have with augmented reality is a lot of the game developers it's not a problem with
11:00
augmented reality per se is a problem with the ideas people are having a lot of the time people are having these
11:06
ideas of board games you can put a a board game on a table and you have these
11:11
3D characters and special effects and meteorites and Dragons come down and moving and that's kind of cool for a
11:18
movie aspect but what about games that involve moving around and puzzle solving
11:24
and you know different parts it's not just stuck on a table and a lot of other augmented reality is
11:31
kind of I don't know what to call it it's the Nintendo DS effect where they give you those cards and then you can
11:37
look at them and a little character pops out same kind of concept as the the board game now that being said
11:44
there's this cool project somebody's messing around with and I really like it it's basically portals it's there's not
11:50
a whole lot to it you've got two portals and you can smack the objects around between these portals so you pass it
11:57
into that portal it'll come out the other one on the other side and you can pass it through and that's a really neat concept because now you're getting out
12:03
of the space of tabletop things and you're getting into the space of
12:09
objects moving within your space and you're interacting with them with your hand in this scenario so of course you
12:17
have the challenge of not being able to feel the objects so it's it's a little difficult to to
12:24
perceive but this guy seems to be handling it just fine he's
12:31
I think it does a palm check from the looks of it kind of like a like a flat plane is where the hand is and that's
12:39
what he's kind of using to bash this stuff around it's really cool so this is the kind of stuff I'm hoping to
12:45
see more in the future I want to see more games like this imagine escape room kind of scenario where you
12:52
can multiplayer with a friend things could be hidden in the room or you can find levers and pull them and things
12:58
other things changing the room it's just I think there's a lot of cool things we can do with this kind of
13:05
concept and get out of the gimmick realm of augmented reality
13:11
so if you guys have any suggestions or concepts augmented reality let me know if you like virtual reality more than
13:20
augmented reality I'd love to hear your Arguments for it I I think that
13:25
you know there's a lot of things in that space you can think of all the games that are out there you can
13:31
think of as Zuckerberg land whatever it's called I can't remember
13:37
metaverse so there's a lot of stuff out there for VR so it does have substance I'd like to
13:44
see a lot more kind of go into augmented reality and I have another
13:49
time I have another thing in this topic of augmented reality and it's this article here let's see let
13:56
me open it up it's mainly just text I want to see if I can
14:03
get a picture of the person using it so
14:09
this this is on the verge this lady is using this augmented reality set from
14:16
what it looks like it's a keyboard looks like it has a track pad and it's connected to these glasses now this
14:23
isn't anything new there's actually quite a few products out there for glasses that connect to some kind of
14:30
device whether it's your phone or a laptop and project screens and all that but in this one it's neat because it
14:36
looks like it doesn't have a screen at all it's just some glasses I guess this is the protective case that
14:42
you can put the glasses underneath you can close this perhaps a keyboard and a trackpad and oh this this camera must be
14:51
for maybe gestures or something like that uh but
14:56
I I haven't fully fully figured out everything that's
15:02
going on in this thing there's a second person using it and I guess this is either a projected example or it's
15:10
potentially a mock-up of what this dude sees it's the same device
15:16
I think this might be a mock-up of what they're saying but like this is this is really cool this is
15:23
you don't have a screen that you're kind of staring at you can put it at a nice viewing distance if you're like me and
15:29
you have eyes with two different that require two vastly different lenses for
15:36
glasses this is fantastic because you can get the effect of having things more clear
15:44
through this digital medium and what I mean by that is for example it's hard to
15:49
explain I have so in my right eye it's it's much more blurry than my left eye
15:55
my left eye is actually pretty good my right eye is incredibly blurry his accident when I was a child there is a
16:01
when I look at the viewfinder in a camera with my blurry eye it's clear as
16:07
day it's I can see everything around it's like wearing super glasses so
16:13
augmented reality I feel like has a fantastic benefit of being able to make
16:19
those screens clearer because you'll be able to adjust the
16:24
kind of the lenses and their focus and all that sort of stuff so it's just uh I
16:31
don't know it's going to be wonderful I can't wait for it I I'd really like to try this this device out I'm sure it's
16:36
going to be super expensive so I'm probably not going to try anytime soon but the moment this sort of device becomes more commercial and consumer
16:43
grade it's probably going to be something that I mess with even if I look like a dork with the glasses on I mean whatever it
16:50
doesn't matter especially if I'm in privacy of my own home uh I mean
16:55
what does it matter so super excited about augmented reality super excited about seeing these things coming to
17:00
augmented reality the concepts and and all of these new gadgets uh I don't know
17:06
I'm just really hyped about this unfinished projects this is something
Unfinished projects
17:12
that plagues developers of all kinds as a game developer I know it plagues me
17:19
constantly to to never finish projects and I've seen a
17:25
lot of Articles there's articles and and basically every single development news
17:34
blog site in existence who is either talking about
17:40
the graveyard of all of the projects that they've never finished or they talk
17:46
about ideas on how to actually finish projects now
17:52
I I do feel somewhat incomplete when I have this big
17:59
idea for a project big grandiose idea got all the bells and whistles one of the problems I have is that I maybe
18:06
replay the entire Concept in my head so many times that it gets boring and I
18:11
move on to something else but you know that's the way it works now
18:16
some some advice on Dead projects there'll always be another project and
18:24
we have all come up with ideas that we gave up on that somebody else wound up finishing and making tons of money on
18:29
it's it's happened to all of us at least three or four of my projects Somebody went out and made millions of dollars
18:36
doing the same thing except they've completed it so it has extra things that I made I didn't think of
18:43
so I generally I think it's good to
18:48
first calm down and relax life is long life is short
18:55
there are many more important things than finishing projects your kids are having kids in the at all
19:02
that's a fantastic thing that I know you think it's probably a cliche if you
19:08
don't have kids to think that everybody ugh everyone says that and then they have kids also and they're all about
19:14
kids now it does give a completely new meaning to life and a whole new purpose
19:20
and just by its very nature but I'm not here to talk about that I'm
19:25
just here to say that's one of many things it could be the the studies you
19:31
have with friends or the groups that you go and meet up on or the random projects you do with groups or your work or your
19:38
church or there's so many things in the list of of more important things than
19:43
finishing your project don't let finishing your projects or Dead projects or graveyards of projects
19:50
make you feel bad I don't feel bad for all the projects that I've not completed and it is a lot my GitHub is enormous I
19:58
have to scroll a long way to look through and find an old project
20:03
and that's you know one of the best things that come out of not completing projects
20:11
and just doing the Parts you like and then going on to something else or any of that is
20:18
that it's iteration you learn from it each time you do that you make some progress on either a new idea or you
20:25
become a better developer just in general whether you learn some art learn some programming or what have you
20:32
now I know that I've learned tons of stuff as far as networking and art and
20:38
tools for art and game engines and code and code paradigms and good structure
20:44
and everything else because sometimes my projects are just about doing a project that fits a code
20:50
standard that I've never done before and those Dead projects all add up you
20:55
know in your mind and it gives you that history that you can then use later
21:01
so all the articles that I see a lot of people either complaining about
21:06
how it makes them feel absolutely terrible they get burned out and they take breaks I've talked about this
21:12
before I've never been burned out burnt out and in the past 15 years and I I
21:17
don't see myself getting burned out on programming in the next 15 either or until I die I'll probably probably die
21:23
with my hands on the keyboard typing out some line of code or something so
21:28
don't let it get to you I I it's just something that I think has been creeping
21:33
up a lot it's crept up a lot over the past couple years since 2020 because a lot of people have been trying to
21:40
to make some kind of projects now there's a lot of programmers out there and there's a lot of people making
21:45
projects you can't expect to be the guy that's that's what I tell
21:51
um my friends and some of my family who feel depressed whenever they didn't complete something or they can't stick
21:56
to a regiment is you don't need to be the guy the guy is
22:03
out there in the world and he'll do great things but the Grass Is Always Greener that person wishes they're you
22:08
and you wish there you wish you were them it's just how it goes just enjoy the process of coming up with
22:15
ideas writing them down drawing them sketching them making flow charts coding
22:22
up stuff trying out new engines and new languages just enjoy it it's would you rather be sitting around watching TV all
22:29
day I'm sure that a lot of people who listen to podcasts like this are thinking about something or they want to
22:35
work on something or they have it in the background there's it's just a it's another form of entertainment I
22:42
would like to I think is what I'm getting at is when you do these projects it's
22:48
entertaining and that's what it should be and that's the whole point of doing them is to have fun so don't have high
22:55
expectations for your project just do the things that you love about it if you're tired of it move on it's
23:02
it's that simple and obviously we're pretty good at that because we have graveyards of projects now don't we
3 quick tech news
23:08
so three quick articles that I came across today one is Twitter blue
23:14
subscribers now can upload to our videos I think it was an hour before if you're
23:19
into Twitter blue then you get longer videos it's good to see that they're
23:25
adding features to Twitter blue I know it was a big old stink I have no opinion I I don't think that
23:33
I don't like to make everything a political argument I think some things just you know let sleeping dogs lie so
23:42
I in principle because it attempts to move
23:50
away from advertising and collecting your data even though they continue to do that I think if
23:56
Twitter was able to get the subscriber backing that they needed they would
24:01
probably phase out ads just as a feature if you do Twitter blue it'll completely
24:06
remove ads so I think that adding these new features
24:11
to Twitter blue is is great it's great to see that they're adding them I mean this isn't a huge one it's just
24:17
extending the frame uh the frame the the time length of videos but not bad
24:22
hopefully we'll see some more and I'm interested to see how that how that goes so the next one is the steam deck the
24:30
steam deck is has a full HD uh plus display upgrade and here's the article
24:39
on that from XDA Developers it's a hundred dollars
24:45
and it upgrades to 1920 by 1200 for the
24:51
resolution from what it currently is which is 1280 by 800. I'm assuming the HD Plus the plus is the added pixels on
24:59
the on the vertical because it's not 1920 by 1080. now I checked through this ad and I
25:06
didn't see anything about how it affects your battery life I assume if you're going to be driving a higher density
25:14
display you're probably going to wind up using more battery for me personally
25:20
I wouldn't pay a hundred dollars for this upgrade because I hold the steam
25:26
deck at a comfortable distance from my face and I can play it it feels good everything looks fine the size of the
25:33
screen it plays well with the with the resolution if you're one of those people
25:38
who are more affected by seeing the pixels and the density maybe this
25:44
upgrade is for you I don't know I I it's it's definitely cool if somebody does this upgrade please let me know how you
25:52
feel about it does it drain your battery you know I I do want to see more steam
25:57
deck mods because I love the steam deck I have a steam deck I bought my wife the steam deck it's a great device I know
26:03
there's New Alternatives now with Asus I think but uh the steam deck is nice because it's a
26:10
it's sold a lot and it's a constant kind of a fixed type of device right now so
26:16
the dimensions and all that and their uniform and so a lot of cool kind of
26:21
gadgets and add-ons and those sorts of things can be added for it so yeah check this out if it's something that
26:27
interests you steam Deck full HD Plus display and a hundred dollars doesn't
26:33
seem that bad for a display upgrade I don't know I don't upgrade displays it's
26:38
cheaper than a monitor a 1080p monitor so maybe maybe that's worth it
26:45
and then the third and the third quick story that I have is stability AI
26:50
releases stable stable Studio an open source
26:56
future of dream studio so this is an image generation uh AI I haven't used it but
27:04
maybe once or twice just to play around with it you go to the site you have some tokens it's kind of like the Bing it's
27:10
kind of like the being I think being used as Dolly from openai where you get some tokens and you can
27:17
generate some some pictures based on using those tokens and then you buy more tokens for Bing you search more and get
27:23
tokens that you can use so our coins I don't know what Bing calls them but the
27:29
stability AI has released a GitHub repository let me see if I can load it
27:35
up here here's their their landing page about it open they
27:42
have stable studio if I click on this it'll take me to GitHub now this was exciting at first because I
27:49
thought oh we're getting closer to more local AI which is what I want I want private local AI I don't want
27:55
cloud-based AI I think that's let's just asking for disaster I want
28:02
local private Ai and I want to be able to send my local private AI to go on the
28:07
internet to do things for me anonymously so I don't have to go on there and and drudge through the the madness that is
28:17
coming from all the AI stuff that's about to spawn on the Internet or already has a spawn on the internet now
28:25
this is not a step closer to private local AI it's nice that they made it it
28:30
seems like it's just taking their their web studio uh
28:36
app web app and allowing you to run it locally now it does not run the the
28:43
image generation locally you are required to use your API key for
28:48
stability AI so it's basically saying instead of using their website
28:54
and costing them money to host the website you host it and still pay for
29:00
the API key and that makes sense everybody's got to make their money right it's a capitalist Society no
29:05
problem with that I want these guys to continue I want them to thrive I want them to explore and you know go to the
29:12
New Frontier of of artificial intelligence but I'm more interested in private local personal AI things that
29:20
that's it's kind of like I know that man it's probably a pipe dream because
29:26
you know you imagine that your your phone is your private local device but
29:31
it's not you have apple watching everything you do knowing everything you're doing how fast you're going
29:37
obviously they do the emergency alerts and hiding behind the auspices of
29:43
protecting lives is a great way to spy on people honestly they think they've
29:48
got it they've got the they've got the formula right there for that but I I really want to see more
29:56
private just locally AI that's mine and I doubt we're going to see it we're going to see
30:02
companies that come up with private local AI devices and maybe there will be some that are
30:07
genuine but the biggest the biggest hitters like I bet you this will be something Google and Microsoft and Apple
30:14
and everybody else does they'll probably tie it to the phone and it's not private
30:20
and local if it uses their web services or tracks what you do or or any of that
30:25
sort of nonsense so I do I'm a hopeful person I'm mostly an
30:30
optimist for all of life everything I try to see the the Silver Lining everything and I see wonderful things
30:37
with private local ai ai that I can tell to do things or come up with ideas or go on
30:45
the internet do things for me all that sort of stuff I think that's a wonderful thing and capturing memories like you
30:51
know we use phones to take pictures and videos but if I can store them an AI and AI can replay them and then when I'm
30:57
dead potentially be something that I can my kids can review or they could just
31:04
throw it away it doesn't matter to me however they want to grieve that's fine with me but I just think it'd be really
31:10
cool to do more local private Ai and unfortunately this sounded like it was but really it's
31:17
just I think it's just the web I actually tested it it use yarn fire up the web API and then it just does API
31:23
requests to their service so I think you might be able to hook it up to something like
31:33
it definitely isn't going to be a one-click solution right now I'll have to look more into it and let
31:39
you know what what I find but maybe that's the future is it takes this web API front end that or this web front end
31:46
that allows you to to query an AI and then you can change the back end that would be pretty pretty
31:53
dope but I don't know if that's what it is we shall find out so that's three
31:59
kind of quick stories and yeah let me know what you think Google is back at
Chrome ends cookies
32:05
its shenanigans so there's there's been an there's been an
32:13
announcement that Google is going to be turning off third-party cookies for one percent of chrome users
32:19
by uh q1 of 2024. so
32:25
anybody may be thinking about this and say well that's awesome you know cookies are annoying they track US they they
32:32
their way of of saving little bits of data and seeing us
32:38
cross sites and all this other sort of craziness especially when you start embedding say Google logins or Facebook
32:45
logins or whatever Integrations with third-party stuff then they can start tracking the people who
32:52
come to your website or your web application or your mobile app or any of those
32:58
so yeah at first it sounds this is fantastic now
33:04
those of us who think about security and use browsers that are more secure
33:11
um all right you know like Firefox or Brave
33:17
we use those browsers because they automatically block cookies or you may have privacy Badger or you may have you
33:23
know any of the various other plugins to block cookies and and stop
33:29
trackers and you may use duck.com or DuckDuckGo as it's called
33:35
the funny news for funny funny story about that Google actually
33:41
registered duck.com a while back a long time ago to prevent DuckDuckGo from registering
33:48
it I think there was a whole lawsuit about it but DuckDuckGo now finally owns
33:54
duck.com which is awesome it's good that they're not into that weird battle and it's a
33:59
lot easier to type duck.com than it is to type DuckDuckGo .com or whatever so
34:05
anyways that aside you may be thinking this is a great idea Google that sounds
34:11
great now what a lot of people point out is that Google as we've stated earlier
34:19
is is in the practice of favoring themselves and their third
34:27
party partners and people who use their services and ultimately make the money obviously they're a corporation they
34:34
want to make money they're going to do that so in general the background of this is
34:40
Google has been talking about getting rid of these is the third party
34:45
cookies notice it's called third-party cookies since 2020 and in three years that's not happened
34:52
at all now uh what Google is announcing is that in Chrome build 115 which is going to be
35:00
released in July which is a couple months from now it will include the Privacy sandbox
35:07
feature flag and you can go into the the Privacy sandbox so you can go into the
35:12
settings the flags of chrome and you can turn it on at that point to block those
35:19
cookies the goal is that this is a temporary thing for people and and they're just
35:26
going to have it integrated normally so it's going to be a good benefit to
35:32
stop tracking but it's going to be a bad thing because they don't mention anything about their cookies and of
35:38
course it's their browser they can see every site you go to so it seems a little unfair to to block everybody else
35:43
but you're special like uh I think that just one-ups the
35:49
browser Wars uh which is which is probably one of the reasons Microsoft has hit so hard with Bing and
35:55
Bing chat recently and you know it's been pretty effective from what I can tell
36:01
so now in order for Microsoft to do the tracking that they want or need they
36:07
have to have people in their browser so just do yourself a favor get out of
36:12
the browser Wars of the big companies get off of chrome you don't have to get off of chromium
36:17
basically every browser but Firefox is chromium you can you can have multiple browsers
36:24
installed I have Brave is my default browser right now and I have Firefox which is my default browser on Linux and
36:30
so I interchange them it just it it's more convenient and
36:37
I don't know I don't know why it's convenient it's convenient on Linux because it usually comes with Firefox built in I guess
36:43
maybe that's why but use browsers like those which already do the blocking and they're not
36:49
biased because they block Google and they block Microsoft just the same and
36:54
maybe they'll block Google harder than the rest and that's okay with me because Google is a tyrant with tracking so
37:01
yeah swap your browsers this is a cool story but
37:07
really it seems like it's just a way for for Google to take more control from
37:13
other people who aren't Google and it's maybe a way for them to bully people into using their services like AdSense
37:20
and all those other uh their their web tracking stuff add words
37:25
webmaster tools it's probably a way of bullying people to stick with them which
37:30
is unfortunate so just go to another browser ignore Google and the rest so
37:35
that's my advice on that piece of news good to see but plenty of other browsers
37:41
have already beaten you to it and plenty of plugins have two so it's good for the the less technical
37:47
people I guess as you may know I am a programmer by day and by night and by
DotNet preview 4
37:54
weekend and always I'm always a programmer but at night I Moonlight as a
38:00
podcaster so now we're going to talk a little bit about code .net 8 is being released if you haven't
38:08
heard this is all all the.net people rejoice I I find that this one is mostly just
38:17
kind of like build stuff which is cool better build stuff easier build stuff
38:23
the the that's that's always nice when you focus on that and you don't add ridiculous parts to your languages like
38:29
C sharp I love C sharp but man do they add some confusing things in there uh
38:36
nullables are a really cool concept for example and they're good if you
38:42
start your project with nulls or nullables are non-nullables but
38:48
but if you add it in the middle of a project it really just wrecks things and
38:53
I've I've had people add them into the middle of projects before and it becomes Madness so some of the features are cool
39:01
just in isolation I suppose so this one seems to be mostly
39:09
this is from from somebody on dev.2 which I think is a Dev blogging site
39:16
um so there's Ms build output upgrade
39:21
there is tweaks to the output path there's nougat
39:27
stuff um package signing for Linux
39:32
dependencies auditing I don't know what this is I handle
39:39
vulnerable packages like a pro oh I guess this is just old packages or haven't been updated in a while
39:45
uh embrace the power of you uh oh YouTube span formattable so utf-8's been
39:54
in c-sharp for a long time so you should have been embracing the power of utf-8 all along by the way I
40:01
embraced the power of utf-8 in my C code which I have to write functions for
40:06
utf-8 myself so you should be using it in a language that fully supports it but it looks like it's getting some added
40:14
niceties which is always nice to say the least
40:21
let's see ahead of time compiler so uh did you know I've done
40:27
any preview for console ahead of time now one of the problems like with iOS is
40:34
it does not allow for support of just-in-time compilers it doesn't like they don't want you
40:40
adding scripting stuff in there or anything like that you got to have pre-compiled ahead of time all the way
40:46
and this is one of the reasons Unity had to swap and create il-2 CPP to convert
40:52
everything from c-sharp IL to C plus plus now there's a lot there's a
40:58
misconception that people have that that just magically makes your code faster it does not I don't know if you've seen the
41:03
generated C plus code it is madness now it may be faster in certain algorithms
41:09
because the compiler that compiles the C plus I don't know exactly which one they use it's probably clang
41:16
can pick up on code patterns and optimize a lot of the code in that way so
41:21
there are areas where it can get faster but in general it might actually be slower than the standard c-sharp stuff
41:29
so anyways that's that's a whole tangent on just in time compiler sorry about that we've got some Json deserialized
41:36
stuff more Json stuff and some logging updates so this is kind of I think a
41:42
a quality of life upgrade not not a whole bunch of new
41:47
system libraries or any of that I don't think it really needs a whole lot more there's quite a bit in C sharp to take
41:53
advantage of you can't really use everything in one project there's so much stuff so those of you who like dot net are
42:01
probably gonna like this I will uh put the put the link to this article I'm sure you can find any there's tons of
42:07
net eight uh things out there I just thought this was nice because it was a kind of a
42:13
little breakdown with with animated images so yeah I'll put this on Twitter I'll
42:19
put this in the description for you to check it out but net eight is here okay
Outtro
42:25
so that's going to do it for today hopefully uh hopefully that was informative let me know if you have any
42:31
ideas for things you want me to talk about or maybe some cool stories in Tech
42:37
or programming or game development or just any of those kind of fields that you think I'd like just Cinema my way I
42:45
love going over this kind of stuff so thanks for watching and until next time
42:50
bye for now
