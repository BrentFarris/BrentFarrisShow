1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
all right welcome back uh today I learned that valve is getting sued for the steam deck

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
um other than that I want to talk about uh private chats some AI stuff some

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
local AI stuff clean code and GitHub and that sort of stuff

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
so I guess uh the very first thing straight off I just learned about it a

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
minute ago was that valve is now getting sued or I

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
don't know a lawsuit has been filed for the steam deck and

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
you may be wondering what on Earth could it be over and um

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
that's exactly what I was thinking and it's for a patent

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
no steam didn't or valve didn't just blatantly copy a patent or steal it or

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
anything like that it's just that valve is falling prey to patent troll

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:60,000
um if you don't know what a patent troll is it's basically a Consortium of people who buy up

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
software and Hardware patents and they produce nothing themselves they just sit

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
around on their thumbs doing nothing other than they had some money to buy some ideas from people that were

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
probably smarter than they are or maybe they're not as smart as they are because they're the ones who bought all the patents and essentially what they do is

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
they sue everybody and force them to pay them uh you know royalties

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and uh the the patent that they that I didn't even know is a patent as haptics

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
so the little vibrations that you feel on basically everything from phones to

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
controllers uh those apparently are patented by some

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
dudes somewhere who had enough money to buy the patent and then do nothing other than sit there

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:60,000
and reap rewards of everyone else's success I'm a little annoyed at it I I've always

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
disliked patent trolls I think they're I put the way that I put it is on

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Twitter was uh there the the idea guys that do nothing and set mom's basement and uh you know perhaps all the other

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
guys went off and they made something successful but this dude had Equity so he's just gonna reap the rewards for you

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
know existing it's very annoying um it sucks I think it stifles

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
innovation um yeah I I it's it's basically my take

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
on that in fact here we're gonna we can take a look at it here I have the

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
the link this is from The Verge you can see well it's night from you

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
morning or tonight for me morning for you um this just just happened a minute ago uh

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
the company is called immersion Corporation and that right there that name uh kind

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
of gives away the game immersion Corporation sounds like we bought up all the patents for haptics

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
that we could find on the internet and are going to sue everybody into the ground and otherwise that force them to

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
pay us royalties and also give us a big chunk of change right at the beginning underneath the table otherwise we're

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
we're going to see you um it's really annoying immersion Corporation I even I even

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
looked up who the heck is immersion Corporation and it's just a bunch of flashy videos

35
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
of look phones and stuff and they produce

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
nothing as far as I can tell on here um just some company that

37
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I would dare say stole patents with money stole it with money anyways

38
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
that's really annoying um it happens to the best of us valve is

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
probably just going to pay them the money under the table or out of the court to skip the lawsuit and just pay

40
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
them royalties so that's that's

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm a little miffed about that I don't know if other people have the same feelings about it I'm sure

42
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
a lot of people are ambivalent to it it just annoys me um the guys who who do nothing and you

43
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
know prey on others it's it's a little huh

44
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
anyways well that's that one of the things I wanted to go over today other

45
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
than that since that popped out of nowhere was private messages

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
so Twitter recently released their uh secure messages I think that they were

47
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
in talks with the guys from signal and they produced a their

48
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
untrustable uh or don't trust the don't trust it yet

49
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
messaging system that's just something that they mentioned don't trust it yet

50
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
give it a try though and now I'm not I'm not a Twitter hater or I don't know

51
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
whatever bandwagon people have about all that what I like is that

52
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
there are uh private messages at all uh secure

53
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
messages at all a company like this does not have to add secure messaging to

54
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
their app they could just go on being completely insecure and

55
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
that's that's not great for the people um it doesn't actually look nobody is is

56
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
saying I'm going to make a Twitter account now because the messages are secure I I'm pretty sure most people

57
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
don't even use Twitter direct messages I've never even used it I'd like to use it now that it's secure

58
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:60,000
I'd like to see what it looks like because they're a little like padlock or something um

59
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm curious not something I'm gonna jump ship from I use signal for all of my

60
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
private messages with my family both my immediate family like my wife

61
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and I almost exclusively talk on Signal and I have a family group chat on there where I talk with all of my family

62
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
and sure it does use up a lot of your storage because it's locally stored

63
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
that's the whole point is that it's not stored on somebody's server somewhere so I'm probably not going to be jumping

64
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
ship off of signal anytime soon maybe even ever it all depends on you know

65
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
where they take it uh you know companies like this could promise the world and

66
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
then swap out from underneath you to doing something else I think

67
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
though I like telegram um I don't actively use it because it's

68
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
hosted on somebody's server somewhere and they kind of just promise security and safety and that sort of

69
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
stuff and you can trust it lots of people do and they could be telling the truth but

70
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I do like the idea of it all being locally on my device even if it is a little bit of an annoying of an

71
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
annoyance taking up the space and then having to make backups and then not being able to transfer it to another

72
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
device like my desktop there are annoyances for it not being a server and I would host my own and or make my

73
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
own little messaging app for my family and I've done you know Divi Helman encryption the whole process of updating

74
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
the key on every message and all that sort of stuff for fun but you know making a whole app that my whole family

75
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
is willing to jump on and even friends and new friends are willing to jump on it's not going to happen so it's a lot

76
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
easier for me to just use it but moral of the story here is that I love that

77
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Twitter is moving towards these secure DMS everything should be security M's

78
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
it's just you know it's out of respect for the people who use your platform I mean

79
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
all in all they are trying to advertise to you and you never know what's going on in the background and I think these are also on the server

80
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
kind of obviously so same difference between you know Twitter DMS and uh

81
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
what's the one Facebook owns that one

82
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and uh in Telegram and all those so um stigma signal because it's local I

83
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
mean it does now signal does store it on a server until it gets delivered and confirmed that it's delivered so there

84
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
is that there's that little middleman aspect there but um it's kind of like a a cousin of mine

85
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
he said he loves Apple because of their secure messages and then I asked him I was like well you

86
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
know they do have secure messages but if you buy a new phone

87
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
and you get all of your old messages out of nowhere that means that all the

88
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
messages were stored on some server and they can be decrypted uh on a different device just the

89
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
different device that exists that just so happens to exist with your phone number I don't know if it's locked to your phone number or anything

90
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
um so you can get all of your old messages and they all get decrypted so that that right there just means that it

91
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
exists somewhere and it can be decrypted so you know security is in the promise I suppose on that

92
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
but yeah that was my thoughts on uh Twitter secure DMs if anyone exists out

93
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
there that wants to try it out uh send me a message on Twitter and uh

94
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
yeah thank you so uh that's basically it for the

95
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
secure messaging stuff I don't want to go on too much of a rant for that um

96
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
now I I did want to talk about some AI stuff as you know I I deal with AI stuff

97
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
for fun I like making random prompts that sort of stuff nothing serious so I

98
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
am not up to date on all the crazy newness and all the things people are doing now and the tricks and that sort

99
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
of stuff so I just learned about GPT for all today

100
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
which was pretty neat uh if you haven't heard of it it's basically a local instance

101
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
um of these different models that you can run locally on your computer without

102
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
internet and depending on your computer's processing power it'll

103
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
be slower or faster and you don't need a GPU to to run it I

104
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I think that's because they most of the training happens through gpus but this

105
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
is not training it I think there is a way to train your own stuff so which would be pretty cool like you'd take all

106
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
the documents you've ever written or maybe all the transcripts of all your videos or something like that and train

107
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
the model on it to be kind of like a mini you which would be kind of neat to see

108
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
but I like it just for its local instance so I wanted to point that out I

109
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
have I wanted to show which model I'm using because uh the website itself says that this is

110
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
the good model so um let's see if I can zoom in oh I can't

111
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
zoom in it's uh GPT for all JV 1.3 groovy

112
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
and if you go to GPT for all here let's just grab this and stick it up here

113
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
on their website um they just boast about its features if

114
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
you can't find the model you want they do have this little drop down that tells you about the different models so the one

115
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
that's already selected is the one that I downloaded for me it was the second from the top but I'm sure those shift around and it's the current best

116
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
commercial commercially licensable model based on GPT J

117
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
um and Commercial commercially licensable the reason that there is uh

118
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Distinction on these is that you can you can actually run a server with this

119
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
local instance and you can run Python scripts to query against it and act as

120
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
like a client and you can serve up servers and like make money using it and

121
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
all that sort of stuff however these models are licensed somebody did all the effort in training them so this

122
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
particular one you can pay somebody I guess to use it if you want to use it commercially there are other ones uh

123
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
like this snoozy one current best non-commercial commercial commercially

124
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:60,000
licensable model and the reason for that is that this is based on uh Lama 13B

125
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
which is I think the Facebook leaked stuff so that's why you can't I mean you can't

126
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
be like yo Facebook I'm going to use that thing that got leaks from your company can I give you a couple bucks so

127
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
obviously you can't do that but yeah go give this a try I was playing around with it on my laptop which is a it's a

128
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Linux laptop with a Intel 11th gen tiger Lake I think

129
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
it's not yeah tiger Lake processor and it was fast enough it was pretty decent

130
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
it wasn't like incredibly slow you'll try some of these offline ones and they're super slow it was decently fast

131
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I haven't tried it on this computer yet this laptop much more beefy 12th gen uh

132
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Intel Core processor um so I would be surprised if this one

133
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
wasn't even faster so yeah go give go give this uh go give this a shot

134
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:61,000
and try out that model it's the second from the top for me like I said just review it on

135
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
the website and pick the model that you find most interesting

136
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
another thing that I learned about today like I said I'm just passively

137
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Nai person prompter whatever I don't make images or anything I just like to prompt

138
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
it and see what kind of stuff it comes up with and cross-reference it and or cross check it

139
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I don't know check its work and that sort of stuff I do like to generate very

140
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
small scripts that I really am too lazy to write so an example of a script that

141
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I wrote that I I modified I asked the AI to

142
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
write it for me was a Lua script that took in a text file and this text file had time marks and then text of what was

143
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
being said at those time marks and it converted it into SRT file which

144
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
is just uh you know a a closed captioning kind of timing file that

145
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
prints out the text that's being said at that time at that time step stamp so I just told it to write me that

146
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
script and it busted one out had a couple mistakes in it it didn't check for uh you know blank lines and that

147
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
sort of stuff that I I just uh quickly knocked it out and fixed it and also

148
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
added a little extra feature so it would spit out a an extra text file which was just the raw text of what was said

149
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
without timestamps so I do play around with these uh for all sorts of things uh

150
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
stories and code and all that but something I learned about today was super prompt

151
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
which is an awesome name I do love when names are

152
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
nice like the I don't know fun fun like this some names can be really boring like they're just named after

153
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
people like some of these models like Ada or DaVinci or whatever cool you named it after

154
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
person but super prompt that's that's awesome it's very it's very uh I mean

155
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Super is used for a ton of things um basically you can probably be sued by

156
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Nintendo by putting super in front of stuff and it they've used it so much but

157
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I don't know I I like the title of it so uh what I learned about the super prompt

158
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
today is basically you either set up a really big prompt it's this huge prompt

159
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
that uses almost all of your tokens and if you don't know what a token is it's essentially you get 40 96 tokens or so

160
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
depending on the service you use and what you pay for and all of that and each about a third of each word is a

161
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
token so just say like each word is a token and it really depends it could be the characters if you're using utf-8 or

162
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
whatever and you're using foreign characters it may be per character that's presented but generally in

163
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:61,000
English I think the what they stated is it's on average about 75 percent of a

164
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
word and you can have up to 4096 of these tokens and then you uh when you hit that

165
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
limit it won't respond or it just doesn't know what to do or um often it'll say uh too much text or

166
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
whatever the the web page or whatever even the local ones do this they'll say I file too long or something like that

167
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
but you can either pre-prompt it with one gigantic prompt and

168
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
have it tried to see things it shouldn't say some people try to make it say bad words or whatever but others try to make

169
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
it sound even more human or like you're talking to some some specific character

170
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
in history and making it making it kind of reply as if it was that person so

171
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
the super prompt isn't always just the one big prompt in the beginning it's

172
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
also you're able to do it by feeding it multiple prompts over and over

173
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
and kind of building out this super context I'll call it I don't think it's

174
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
called super context but I'm going to call it super context and what people do is they they call it

175
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
hypnosis they like they they hypnotize the AI so to speak by repeating things

176
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
they've previously said in varied ways in order to kind of Shepherd it into a

177
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
certain uh Direction and that's just so that they can hit the neurons that aren't often hit you know on the fringes

178
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
of of the uh of the I don't know what to call it AI

179
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Matrix mind and then you can get some pretty cool responses

180
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
um you can see kind of the depth of its understanding of things and I mean understanding of things so those are

181
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:60,000
kind of fun uh that's what I learned about today super prompting so go try to

182
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Super prompt um maybe you've done it without even noticing that you've done it uh here

183
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I've just for completeness I I asked uh

184
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I asked Bing what a super prompt was and this was his response you can pause uh

185
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
to see this um I guess if you're doing an audio only uh podcast uh it says it says the super

186
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
prompt is a term uh used in the context of chat GPT I don't know if it's

187
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
specific to chat GPT I just know it's used commonly with chat gbt and other

188
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
similar language models uh refers to a prompt that is designed to generate a more advanced and complex response from

189
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
the model super prompts are used to train the model and generate more sophisticated responses that are closer

190
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
to human-like conversation they're usually more detailed and specific rather than prompts that can include

191
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:61,000
multiple parts or subparts and these prompts can get long by the

192
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
way so I think somebody recorded like I don't know if it was 16 minutes or 16

193
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
hours for chat gbt to respond with one of these super prompts and it was uh

194
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
pretty neat so go try super prompts today

195
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
um so we're going to jump from AI I'm going to talk more about some

196
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
programming stuff as you know I'm a programmer I love code I code all the time I code as a day job

197
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I love code so much that I make this podcast and I include code stuff because I just love code

198
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
so you may have noticed a huge Trend in the last few years of people moving to clean

199
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
code I want to use quote clean code or people moving towards uh you know

200
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:60,000
craftsmanship clean architecture all this stuff all these buzzwords and clean

201
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
code is basically like testable Code test driven development for some people

202
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
tiny functions uh making every making it so that your code doesn't need comments

203
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
to explain itself anybody can read it and I like to throw design patterns in there because it's not often said with

204
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
clean code for some reason as far as I've seen but there's some really good design patterns that help you create

205
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
clean code my favorite design pattern is the visitor pattern and that's

206
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
basically where you can create a system that executes some unknown uh maybe

207
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
structured concept it's hard to explain and you pass it a class or you pass it a

208
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
function and that's the mechanic that it runs the context that it runs within so

209
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
in that way you can have this core system that does a specific thing and you can alter it by passing out a class

210
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
with certain functions or functions themselves to change the behavior while

211
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
keeping that one particular piece of code so I think an easy example would be

212
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
like rather than using inheritance to say there is an animal and from the animal there is or there's a being which

213
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
animal derives from and then you have a dog and a cat and they both have speak and they do a different response instead

214
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
of having a hierarchy you can have a flat class that is animal processor and then you pass in a dog

215
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
which has a speak function and you pass in a cat which has a speak function and it does speak that way so you don't have

216
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
to do inheritance and that way um cats and dogs in this scenario don't have any relationship at all they don't

217
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
have to you can use an interface or you can pass them as a function the cat function that does the cat speak

218
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
function or whatever and so the class itself that's managing it just knows that it gets things that speak and it

219
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
runs this big code on it so that's the visitor pattern there's tons of patterns

220
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
just look up the gang the gang of four book if you have the book you can just

221
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
go to the very back uh the very back of the book and it has a list of all the patterns which is nice

222
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
but yes I I will say all that being said do not

223
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
do not uh vehemently abide by Clean code and I'll

224
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
tell you this now I write tests functions to test AI generated code but

225
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I don't often write test functions for my own code and my own projects I make

226
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
small functions that do very specific things which it would be nonsensical for

227
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
me to test because especially when I'm working alone when I'm working with a

228
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:60,000
team it's a different story but when I'm working alone I don't need to over complicate it I know when I write a function I don't change it if I change

229
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
it I'm very specific on how I refactor it whether it gets all deleted and

230
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
replaced with something else or something in that realm so all you clean coders out there

231
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
congratulations for knowing what clean code is and clean architecture and design patterns and test driven

232
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
development and all that sort of stuff but life is life is simple take it take it

233
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
easy don't be Zealot about it and one of the things that you'll find

234
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
is if you adhere too close to clean code and everything's interfaces and everything's abstract and everything's

235
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
going everywhere especially for your own personal projects or projects you put up on

236
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
GitHub as libraries you'll find that you wind up with

237
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
unreadable code anyways even though your your whole goal was to make readable

238
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
code you get way too many intertwined different things or disconnected things even worse

239
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
um one of the things just an aside when I program in unity

240
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I like to leverage Unity so all of it signals all of its how it connects

241
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
different objects I like to leverage it because when another person who's using Unity comes and they they want to work

242
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
with me or they they just see the code or see the project they understand

243
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
what's going on they can find where things are and what things are doing they don't have to go through and find

244
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
the class and then go to its manager and then go to the then go to the facade which manages the manager's list which

245
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
comes from a factory which comes from an abstract Factory they don't need to go through all that to figure out that the

246
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
character can jump they can see just straight in the code exactly what it's doing

247
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
and I get trying to abstract a way to make everything interchangeable and all that but I will argue

248
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
that as a huge proponent of clean code by the way uh in in a lot of scenarios

249
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
especially in working with teams uh it is a major downside and I will argue

250
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
that it will bloat your code and make it unreadable if you adhere to it too far

251
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
and it'll slow down your code because you've you've abstracted everything

252
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
just off to Oblivion so what I like to do in my personal projects is I like to stick to flat

253
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
non-hierarchical refactorable code the most important

254
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
thing in my mind is that I write code that is easy to refactor whether it's deleting whole functions and replacing

255
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
them with another or just changing out being able to

256
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
delete maybe an entire set of files or change out the data structure easily

257
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:61,000
that's what I aim for is refactorable code because I refactor my code non-stop all the time over and over my game

258
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
engine that I was I've written in C has been Rewritten multiple times I've converted it to C plus plus and

259
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
converted back to C twice and I've also refactored the entire math library and

260
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
everything else and so it's been it's like uh what's that joke theseus's ship I I know

261
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
that off top of my head because my wife has been making fun of this person who fixes her husband's shoes and not making

262
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
fun of her but making fun of the people comment on it because every comment is oh it reminds me of Theseus ship but

263
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
that's kind of what my code is like everything's been replaced it's it's not none of the code is the same from the

264
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
original maybe except for some of my standard string string functions and stuff like that

265
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
so that's my thoughts on the clean code try to do clean code but don't don't stick to it too strictly

266
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
um now I I don't want to speak just to Advanced programmers to to more inexperienced programmers

267
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
people who are just learning or learning the ropes or getting into things or you're an advanced programmer you've

268
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
done assembly coding but you haven't done any web one of the things that I've seen in repositories recently which is why I

269
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
want to talk about it is you'll find API keys and other sensitive keys and that

270
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
sort of stuff inside of public GitHub repositories and you know people can take those keys and

271
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
wind up racking up a bill for you in fact I wouldn't be surprised if there's people who Crawl Through the different

272
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
projects looking for keywords for specific apis and see if they can't get a free key for a little bit

273
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
and um and I've seen people ask about it what do you do with you know these keys

274
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
so especially in web or any kind of development it doesn't have to be web you could be deploying uh game server or

275
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
anything like that you don't put your keys anywhere in your code base at all

276
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
if you need to regenerate keys because you forgot it or you've deleted something that you're keeping it at the

277
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
secure place you're keeping it in no big deal regenerate it um

278
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
but what you want to do is when you deploy your

279
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
code your application your game server is that you want to push your key

280
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
through through and add it as the environment variables

281
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
or add it as a file that's inaccessible that's kind of in a weird directory that

282
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
is hard for anyone to access access without you know root privileges or something

283
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
like that just you want to push your keys into your server so don't put it in your

284
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
code base don't put in any code base don't even put it in a private repository just keep them locally

285
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
and push them if you're using Docker often you'll put these in environment variables and just push them off to the

286
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
server so that's just a little tip on that because

287
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I've seen some issues with that so uh oh this one is pretty cool I found

288
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
a random project where somebody was doing a map of GitHub and this was a

289
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
pretty neat project I I like these kinds of things I like especially and like in these

290
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
where it connects things I don't know why they're connected probably because they're Forks of each other or something like that

291
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
but I have this page here called map of

292
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
GitHub and uh this is who it's made by and VA

293
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
and vaka here I mean I can go to his uh he's in Seattle

294
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
does a lot of web stuff anyways um here's uh here's land of unity so we

295
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
can zoom in on the land of unity and you can see a whole bunch of little dots starting to appear

296
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
as you get closer you get inundated with a sea of dots and you can click on I

297
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
think the circle yeah and then you can see all these lines connecting it to things why they're

298
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
connected to those things I don't know like let's go to it page not found oh I

299
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
guess some of these are broken how about you outline effect oh it has uh

300
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
it looks like it's readme here yeah I think it sticks its read me

301
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
inside of there um why is it connected to something else maybe it's a sub-repository or something

302
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
like that it's just a readme a review code I'm not in desktop mode it's

303
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
collapsed maybe it's these packages

304
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
it's probably these packages anyways I don't want to get it I don't want to go browsing through this stuff

305
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
uh in the podcast but I thought this was really neat um if you guys know any

306
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
projects like these just random stuff it's like a mind map basically fbx

307
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
exporter ooh Unity fbx exporter

308
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Unity Technologies I guess this oh this must be the unity's fbx

309
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
exporter plugin no Unity 3 Japan oh maybe anyways like I said I can browse

310
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
these all day long so if you have any that you like um similar to this or you know any language I I uh it doesn't matter to me

311
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
um send them my way I love to look through these um

312
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
so I this is On a related note

313
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
um have you I don't know if you've explored GitHub before it took me a long and like

314
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:60,000
I've had a GitHub account forever and I never went through the explore tab

315
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
um which is hilarious because that's I mean I just showed you I like

316
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
to look around at those kinds of things but um a few years back I started using explore

317
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Tab and so you can find things like this one that I I shared was game engines and

318
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I've done a video in the past like I don't know a while ago a couple maybe a

319
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
year or two ago about all the different game engines that you can find inside of

320
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
GitHub for all different kinds of things 2D 3D Half Baked all that sort of stuff

321
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
of course you're going to have your number one uh most starred stuff up here Godot

322
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
um but you know you'll have I'm gooey I am GUI however you want to

323
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
say it um it's a popular UI Library it's uh

324
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
it's kind of essentially it doesn't keep track of the things it creates it's

325
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
it's an immediate mode that's what im stands for it's an immediate mode where you have to tell it to render stuff what

326
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
it's rendering kind of every frame um but I'm not going to go through all

327
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
these but there's there's all kinds like this is a refreshing a refreshingly simple data driven game engine built in

328
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Rust so uh I guess Bevy must be a popular one for the rest the restarians

329
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
restitonians all the rusties it's pretty cool

330
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
um but there are I was about to say hundreds there are thousands I think there's five thousand

331
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
let me scroll down to the bottom here um maybe it's not at the bottom there's

332
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
oh here it is it was at the top there's almost uh well there's if you round up almost 6 000 uh game

333
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
engines and you know some of them are pretty cool uh I kind of spent some time

334
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
perusing these uh a year or two ago and they were there's

335
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
just some really cool stuff and you can get some pretty cool shaders that people have done there's a lot of you know

336
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
available shaders um with like demos and and Cool Stuff uh I

337
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
like writing shaders but I do like uh checking out what other people do because lots of other people are way

338
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
better at shaders than I am um I don't even I don't even really use Shader graphs I

339
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I I find them too cumbersome for me I like to hand type it but

340
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
um I hate debugging shaders it takes forever so yeah I like to look at other people's

341
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
shaders for inspiration and and that sort of stuff so pretty dope

342
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
uh yeah if you have some time come in here feel free to to browse through

343
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:61,000
the thousands and thousands and thousands of game engines you'll find one for every language and you'll find

344
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
one for every scenario and let's see what you can filter by you can filter by star most fewest

345
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
most Forks that'd be interesting and I've I'd assume it's relative to the Stars

346
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
all right let's find out yep Godot IMG I'm gooey Coco's 2D

347
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I guess it's a little different about the same though I I feel like those two are superfluous

348
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
um or the forks is Superfluous that is the Stars kind of is basically the same

349
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
thing I wouldn't recommend fewer Stars um you're gonna get tons of zeros

350
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
and I don't know what order those are in so recently updated this might be pretty cool

351
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Coco's Creator yeah so if you ever get some time come out here and explore the GitHub

352
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
there's a lot of cool stuff you can select on topics and you can select

353
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
different topics based on what you're interested in one topic that I have saved is C I love looking through C

354
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
stuff I love uh getting ideas from from sea

355
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
and look here's OBS uh but I love just looking through see

356
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
stuff since it's my favorite language lots of good stuff in there so check it out play around and uh

357
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
send me if you find if you find some cool stuff send them my way I'd love to uh look I

358
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
love looking through this stuff like I said so uh I think you know we're coming to the end

359
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
of this and one of the things that there's one other thing that bothered me I hate I I

360
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
strongly dislike to end on a sour note but it's a it's a goofy one to me

361
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
um there's there's this article that was posted and it bothered my wife too where

362
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I don't know if it's called a straw man argument or a gas lighting or what um but it was about not being able to

363
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
play Zelda inside of the uh you know Legend of Zelda series I know ironically you don't

364
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
play a Zelda and Zelda you play as Lincoln Zelda and

365
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I don't think this is they made it seem like everybody on the planet was wanting this to happen

366
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
and you could play a Zelda and tons of games you could play in Zelda you know super smash you can play in Zelda as uh

367
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
what was it called Hyrule Warriors you could play Zelda and like tons of like offshoot games

368
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
um so I don't know if she's in Mario Kart now she might even be in Mario Kart uh I

369
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
don't understand the need for people to come up with problems maybe it's because

370
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
they're being paid to write articles and so they've got to figure out how to spend their day doing something and so

371
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:61,000
they come up with these weird ghosts that they have to chase and the way they word it is like

372
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
everybody on the internet wanted this like with no citation of all the people that wanted it I'm sure there's you know

373
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
a pocket of people that want to play Zelda and a Zelda game but um generally you play Legend of Zelda as

374
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
link that's how it's always been it's a great game for its mechanics you want to focus on the gameplay you want to focus

375
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
on all that sort of stuff you don't want to have to focus on character semantics and altering your

376
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
story and changing your formulas just so you can play as one of the other characters in there and they have lots

377
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
of characters it doesn't just have to be Zelda people are complaining and I mean you could just mod the games

378
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
if you really want to play a Zelda but yeah there's this is the uh the article

379
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
in question uh by thegamer.com Nintendo has no plans to make Zelda a

380
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
playable character it's a news flash big old bold headline right there no plans

381
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
oh how dare they as theories that Zelda would be playable in tears of the Kingdom have proven

382
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
wrong the wrong all those theories I'd never heard once they're all just ugh

383
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
and Nintendo even worst of all Nintendo doesn't plan to change anytime soon

384
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
game that makes them millions and millions of dollars and is huge Smash

385
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Hits they don't want to change it up and you know potentially alienate audiences ugh

386
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
uh yeah it's just I feel like this is I don't know like I said I don't know if

387
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
it's straw man or Gaslight it feels like one of those things where companies point at or no news people in

388
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
general point at something and then they say what do you think about that and they point it and they

389
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
they start asking that to like corporations and stuff like trying to get them the way in on stuff they don't

390
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
need to weigh in on and in my opinion Nintendo and they make tons of money they have

391
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
the IP solid it's a fantastic like everybody loves the characters everybody loves the the storyline even though it

392
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
repeats it's it's a formula that works that people really like they focus on link doing these interesting game

393
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
mechanics so um but yeah they're saying like uh

394
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
however yet again is not the case yet again oh no

395
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
every single time I'm let down every time my Zelda game comes out it's a Smash Hit and I'm always thinking about

396
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
why couldn't I play Zelda um yeah it's

397
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
it's uh they even mention uh that here we go unfortunately

398
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
uh that has many fans wondering if Zelda these mini fans I don't know where they

399
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
are maybe they meant to put m-i-n-i mini fans a small group uh of her playing in

400
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
the mainline game and that's the thing is like why does it have to be Mainline game that's why it's like

401
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
you wanting to make Facebook or something um WhatsApp I just remembered the the chat

402
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
app that's like saying you want to put WhatsApp on the front page of Facebook it is I don't know a you know a lot of

403
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
people use it or like it so might as well swap out your main thing for that it it

404
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
doesn't make much sense business-wise um you you kind of follow the money when

405
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
you're in a business if you've got a formula that works especially that's growing as big as Zelda does uh which I

406
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
think is like their biggest title uh you don't go tweaking that much you you

407
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
make better game mechanics games are about the mechanics games are not about the characters games are not about the

408
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
stories both of those things make games better but that's not what games are

409
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
about they're about what the player does the games are about the player and everybody has to get that in their their

410
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
minds the game is for the player and is about the player you don't need

411
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
to pressure them into worrying about all these things they don't need to worry about just let them have fun playing their game

412
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
okay so that was my rant on this particular article sorry uh whoever you

413
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
are this person um this is this is dumb it's a waste of

414
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
it's a I I don't like these kinds of these kinds of articles that point at

415
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
random ghosts and say why isn't that the way it's I think it should be

416
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
um you know so anyways I haven't played by the way just a side

417
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
note no don't spoil anything for me I have not played the new Zelda game I can't play it you see I'm about to

418
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
have a baby I'm very excited about this baby and I can't get sucked into a video game just as I'm about to have a baby

419
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
she'll be here any day now and I probably won't be able to play the Zelda unfortunately and I really do want to

420
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
play it I probably won't be able to play it for a few months until you know she's stable

421
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I mean you know my wife is all healed up and feeling better I I've already got a

422
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
child to I'm going to be looking after my son basically the whole time because he's

423
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
he's fairly young and uh they're they're pretty close in age I can say so I'm gonna have my hands full

424
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
and I I though I really want to play this game I'm gonna have to hold off on it so no spoilers for me don't tell me

425
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
anything you can tell me what you like in general the public stuff like hey I

426
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
like building cars and and trees into spaceships uh or whatever but

427
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
don't spoil any of the like mechanics they haven't already kind of exposed or anything like that I I like to go and

428
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
blind on these things in fact I a goofy story I I like all the side things in games I

429
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
haven't even finished beating breath of the wild I've done everything like mastered all the cooking stuff I've got

430
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
all the best clothes the last thing that I need to do is beat uh the final boss

431
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
which is Ganon presumably I have I like I said I don't spoil myself on this stuff

432
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
um I haven't even beat him yet because I did everything else and there's a few things I haven't done

433
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I something I like to do like there's a few of the um shrines I haven't completed so something

434
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I like to do is I like to do all of the side things and then beat the final boss

435
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
because then it's like a super completionist feeling moment it feels incredible the downside is six years

436
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
later I have to be the boss but the upside is it feels amazing when I do and uh because one of the one of the things

437
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
that I feel suck is is if you finish the game beat the boss and then there's a

438
00:45:59,000 --> 00:45:61,000
bunch of side things to do it feels like it's backwards order like I feel like you should do all of the adventuring
