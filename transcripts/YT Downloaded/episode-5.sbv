0:00:00.000,0:00:06.240
Jobs for programmers. Some of us need them, some of us have them. I was curious

0:00:06.240,0:00:12.780
about remote work and how it affects the job market, what companies are doing with

0:00:12.780,0:00:19.960
remote work. I work remotely, a lot of you maybe work remotely, and just kind of

0:00:19.960,0:00:23.320
want to take a look at jobs. But before I get into remote work, I want to take a

0:00:23.320,0:00:31.080
look at losing jobs. Lots of people are losing jobs. Yet another story, today, not

0:00:31.080,0:00:35.760
today, a couple days ago Stack Overflow lays off 10% of their employees, and

0:00:35.760,0:00:40.760
that's not a lot. I was surprised to find out that 10% of the Stack Overflow

0:00:40.760,0:00:47.600
employee base was 58 employees, which is pretty astounding. I like that they run a

0:00:47.600,0:00:54.400
tight ship over there. I think that having, I mean, that means they've got 580

0:00:54.400,0:00:58.800
employees. I think that may be a little bit too high to run a question-and-answer

0:00:58.800,0:01:03.720
site. I don't know. I don't run a question-and-answer site. I just think

0:01:03.720,0:01:08.880
that oftentimes we hire too many developers. We hire way too many people,

0:01:08.880,0:01:15.960
and that's usually what is slowing us down at companies interworking with

0:01:15.960,0:01:22.480
people. So perhaps they're figuring this out and, you know,

0:01:22.480,0:01:27.560
laying off people. I've always said that programming is not an assembly line job.

0:01:27.560,0:01:34.400
You can't just add more programmers and then all of a sudden magically produce

0:01:34.400,0:01:40.320
tons more code. There's been studies of this that show that that's never the

0:01:40.320,0:01:45.920
case. You can look at the Mythical Man month from the 70s, and that still holds

0:01:45.920,0:01:50.000
true. Believe it or not, they did hire tons of programmers at companies even

0:01:50.000,0:01:55.600
back then when there weren't that many. So just taking a look at something like

0:01:55.600,0:02:02.040
that, and that information has basically held true this entire time, we can start

0:02:02.040,0:02:06.600
to see that you can't just hire more programmers and more developers and

0:02:06.600,0:02:11.400
expect things to go faster. That's just not how it works. In fact, I think the

0:02:11.400,0:02:20.080
CEO of Nintendo, he famously was shown Mother 3. I don't know which one it was.

0:02:20.080,0:02:26.360
Mother, the game that has like Ness as the main character. I think it's Ness. I

0:02:26.360,0:02:35.040
don't know who it is. Kid with baseball cap and the baseball bat. So it's

0:02:35.040,0:02:39.280
this RPG, and they presented it to him, and he said this is gonna take

0:02:39.280,0:02:48.600
forever to fix. And so he said, we can get it done in six months if we start over

0:02:48.600,0:02:51.880
from scratch. And that's what they did. They started over from scratch, and I

0:02:51.880,0:02:56.200
think it took seven or eight months to complete the game and get it published.

0:02:56.200,0:03:01.640
And that just shows you that sometimes having a lot of legacy code, it's easier

0:03:01.640,0:03:05.040
just to scrap it all and do it from scratch. And I'm a big proponent of that.

0:03:05.040,0:03:12.680
However, it's very hard to pull off in this day and age. Anyways, we have... so

0:03:12.680,0:03:18.840
Stack Overflow fired or laid off. I don't know. Is that any different than firing? I

0:03:18.840,0:03:23.920
think it's the more PC language. But they fired 58 employees, which is 10% of the

0:03:23.920,0:03:31.680
workforce. They were saying that the CEO of Stack Overflow perhaps, or his name is

0:03:31.680,0:03:39.520
I can't even pronounce his name. I'll call him PC. That's his initials.

0:03:39.520,0:03:45.600
Said that layoffs were also a result of taking a hard look at our strategic

0:03:45.600,0:03:51.680
priorities this fiscal year and the organizational structure. And that's

0:03:51.680,0:03:56.720
usually how it goes. They look and see, oh, we have a lot of bloat. We had a heyday

0:03:56.720,0:04:03.400
during that pandemic, hired people maybe for things we didn't need. And now

0:04:03.400,0:04:08.040
we're kind of overpopulated and slowing ourselves down, just kind of drudging

0:04:08.040,0:04:13.800
along. Once the ship gets bigger, it's gonna be harder to push it. So that's

0:04:13.800,0:04:23.280
essentially, you know, as vague as it is, why let it go? They want to pursue

0:04:23.280,0:04:28.560
agility and flexibility with the launch of AI ML focused offerings in the months

0:04:28.560,0:04:34.560
ahead. So everybody's going AI, obviously. I think everybody can can look around

0:04:34.560,0:04:40.840
and see that. Every company, I mean, most of Google I.O. is just AI. That's the

0:04:40.840,0:04:44.080
buzzword. That's what everybody's expecting. It's where all the investors

0:04:44.080,0:04:47.440
are going, even though they probably wouldn't have touched it with a 10-foot

0:04:47.440,0:04:54.760
pole like five years ago. And so Stack Overflow is in jeopardy, honestly. When

0:04:54.760,0:05:01.400
you have a, I mean, I think I've seen articles about a dip in their user base

0:05:01.400,0:05:07.840
ever since like ChatGPT was announced and GitHub Copilot and these kinds of AI

0:05:07.840,0:05:12.720
generated code. And I can see why. It's very easy to just write a comment in

0:05:12.720,0:05:18.080
your code, say, save a file, and it detects the language and it gives you

0:05:18.080,0:05:22.280
basically what you would have went to Stack Overflow for, a little copy and

0:05:22.280,0:05:27.040
paste snippet. So I don't know exactly what they're gonna do with artificial

0:05:27.040,0:05:31.080
intelligence. I think the only way they can save themselves is if they compete

0:05:31.080,0:05:35.680
with things like Copilot and they produce an artificial intelligence that

0:05:35.680,0:05:39.960
takes the entire base of knowledge of Stack Overflow and all the suggestions

0:05:39.960,0:05:47.520
there and kind of works from that. Although Microsoft, you know, they bought

0:05:47.520,0:05:52.200
GitHub for a reason and that was to have access to all the code on GitHub,

0:05:52.200,0:05:57.840
whether we like it or not, to train their AIs. So they have a much bigger code base

0:05:57.840,0:06:04.520
to work from. So that's, you know, just nature of the business. But I

0:06:04.520,0:06:10.800
don't want to focus too much just on Stack Overflow. Ironically, and this one

0:06:10.800,0:06:15.040
is ironic to me because we all know about all the layoffs that are

0:06:15.040,0:06:20.400
happening. There's layoffs at every big company you can think of. Games, software,

0:06:20.400,0:06:29.320
nobody is safe in the software realm. And I don't want to say the funniest, but

0:06:29.320,0:06:36.000
it is kind of funny. LinkedIn cuts 700 jobs and closes their China app. So I can

0:06:36.000,0:06:39.160
understand why they closed their China app. I mean, that's a whole other

0:06:39.160,0:06:47.960
discussion about, you know, Chinese firewall and kind of their regulatory

0:06:47.960,0:06:52.880
stuff that makes it very difficult to do stuff there. So besides the point, but

0:06:52.880,0:06:58.520
they cut 700 jobs at LinkedIn. It's ironic because you would imagine with

0:06:58.520,0:07:02.080
everybody getting laid off from every big company, there's a lot of people who

0:07:02.080,0:07:07.760
are going to be paying for LinkedIn and trying to get jobs. So it's weird to me

0:07:07.760,0:07:17.600
that a job search website, and I have an article here that says, let's see here,

0:07:17.600,0:07:24.560
let's take a look. It says more than 197,000 tech sector employees have lost

0:07:24.560,0:07:31.200
their jobs since the start of 2023. This isn't even talking about 2022. So, you

0:07:31.200,0:07:36.000
know, 200,000 people looking for jobs and LinkedIn is, they're cutting, they're

0:07:36.000,0:07:43.840
cutting 700 jobs from their company, which does that mean people are not

0:07:43.840,0:07:47.720
looking for jobs? Does it mean they're not looking through LinkedIn? Or they

0:07:47.720,0:07:53.280
just, is LinkedIn just not a viable thing for finding jobs? I don't know what to

0:07:53.280,0:07:57.600
take of this. I've gotten jobs through LinkedIn

0:07:57.600,0:08:02.520
recruiters, so it's a little strange to me. I think that it's pretty effective.

0:08:02.520,0:08:08.120
There's a lot of recruiters on there and there's a lot of noise. Daily I get

0:08:08.120,0:08:13.360
recruiters hitting me up for jobs. I sometimes feel like I need to close down

0:08:13.360,0:08:18.800
my thing whenever I take a job that I'm happy with. But there's a lot of

0:08:18.800,0:08:23.760
recruiters and there's, it seems to be a lot of jobs because I, you know, I get them

0:08:23.760,0:08:30.920
for artificial intelligence, games, mobile apps, just the whole spectrum. So, I don't

0:08:30.920,0:08:36.400
know. So it's very odd. I don't know what to take of it. I don't know if it's a

0:08:36.400,0:08:40.760
good omen, a bad omen that they're cutting jobs, but something to think

0:08:40.760,0:08:49.520
about. But they're not the only ones. So, it looks like May 3rd, Unity conducts a

0:08:49.520,0:08:54.840
third round of layoffs. This is the Unity game engine. If you're not a game

0:08:54.840,0:09:02.040
developer, that's the one I'm talking about. They've cut something, about

0:09:02.040,0:09:07.920
8% of their staff, which is another 600 people getting laid off. And I guess this

0:09:07.920,0:09:13.080
is the third round. I have no idea what happened in the first couple of rounds.

0:09:13.080,0:09:21.080
How many people got laid off in that. So, very interesting. Again, games

0:09:21.080,0:09:27.640
are doing great right now, but I don't know if it's just the trend. All the big

0:09:27.640,0:09:32.240
tech bros are talking to each other at their yacht meetups or whatever rich

0:09:32.240,0:09:37.520
people do and saying, hey, look, we can just cut a whole bunch of jobs. Look, Elon

0:09:37.520,0:09:43.400
Musk did it. He cut Twitter to nothing. And still the thing is running and

0:09:43.400,0:09:48.520
tons of people are using it and it hasn't totally collapsed. Maybe we

0:09:48.520,0:09:56.360
can do the same. I don't know. But usually, once one person does it, it really

0:09:56.360,0:09:59.960
starts a chain reaction. They all realize, hey, maybe we're bloated. We need to save

0:09:59.960,0:10:05.320
some money. Inflation is happening. All kinds of weird stuff's happening.

0:10:05.320,0:10:09.640
Banks are collapsing. Maybe we should start cutting people to save money. I

0:10:09.640,0:10:15.440
don't know. But it's very interesting. It's affecting everybody from

0:10:15.440,0:10:20.200
games to software to tech companies. The whole spectrum. Even LinkedIn. If

0:10:20.200,0:10:25.040
LinkedIn's being hit, then you know everything's being hit. That's the way I

0:10:25.040,0:10:38.640
see it. I did see something from Times Now News. Amid mass layoffs,

0:10:38.640,0:10:44.800
there's a particular IT company, an Indian IT company, that is hiring like

0:10:44.800,0:10:53.120
1,500 people. That's not unheard of. I actually was fired. I will call it fired,

0:10:53.120,0:10:59.840
laid off, whatever you want to call it. I was laid off. I was part of a

0:10:59.840,0:11:04.400
studio, a game studio, and we were making money. The company was already bought

0:11:04.400,0:11:08.840
once and they were about to be bought again. They decided to lean up.

0:11:08.840,0:11:15.240
What they did was they brought in a bunch of... I don't know if they were... I never

0:11:15.240,0:11:22.080
asked them. I think they were Russian. They may have been Ukrainian. The guy

0:11:22.080,0:11:27.000
that was kind of communicating with them and working with them, he was Russian, so

0:11:27.000,0:11:31.120
I don't know what the people on the other end was. They didn't really explain

0:11:31.120,0:11:35.120
it much. But after working with them and they got integrated with the team, they

0:11:35.120,0:11:41.600
laid off everybody in the United States for that company and offshored

0:11:41.600,0:11:48.120
everything. So it makes perfect sense that they'd be offshoring. Offshore

0:11:48.120,0:11:55.480
companies would be hiring tons and tons of new people. That could be

0:11:55.480,0:12:01.880
exactly what it is. I think that's gonna be unnecessary with all

0:12:01.880,0:12:07.800
the AI stuff that we're creating because it can do it much more efficiently and

0:12:07.800,0:12:13.200
you can have one programmer who's a little more effective maybe. He's got

0:12:13.200,0:12:17.720
a no code. You can't just hire anybody to just put in prompts for

0:12:17.720,0:12:22.480
AI. You've got to have somebody who knows code inside and out. So I guess the

0:12:22.480,0:12:29.280
upper echelons of coders, your jobs are safe. So don't worry about that. So

0:12:29.280,0:12:40.600
there's been a lot of layoffs. Intel did more layoffs on May 9th, it looks like. So

0:12:40.600,0:12:47.640
you've got Intel and Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and just tons of companies

0:12:47.640,0:12:52.760
just even this month laying off people. And I think that we're tired of seeing

0:12:52.760,0:12:58.360
all the headlines because we've seen them basically every month for like a

0:12:58.360,0:13:03.000
year but it's still going and that's that's pretty crazy.

0:13:03.000,0:13:09.680
Luckily I've not had any problems with this since way back when

0:13:09.680,0:13:14.040
and that scenario I was talking about. But it is unfortunate for a lot of

0:13:14.040,0:13:19.280
people. I don't know how to deal with job security there when you're in a huge

0:13:19.280,0:13:24.800
company like these some of these big companies, Intel, Microsoft. They'll

0:13:24.800,0:13:30.160
probably cut important people not even knowing. They just need

0:13:30.160,0:13:37.640
big sections to just disappear so that they can kind of reserve their funds.

0:13:37.640,0:13:42.680
So that's kind of the crazy stuff that's going on and the job stuff. I'm

0:13:42.680,0:13:48.880
not worried at all. If you're secure in your job you don't have to worry. If

0:13:48.880,0:13:51.840
you're a really good programmer and you know many languages and you can go

0:13:51.840,0:13:57.680
cross-discipline you really don't have to worry. You're gonna be fine.

0:13:57.680,0:14:02.640
And if you do get laid off like I said I get tons of stuff in LinkedIn. I

0:14:02.640,0:14:06.840
know there's stuff out there for you. So if you are laid off, if you're not,

0:14:06.840,0:14:14.680
something to think about. Everything's good. That brings us to remote work. So I

0:14:14.680,0:14:17.000
started thinking about remote work today because...

0:14:17.000,0:14:22.700
Elon Musk did a long interview and one of the things that came up with that was remote

0:14:22.700,0:14:23.900
work.

0:14:23.900,0:14:28.020
You probably know Elon's point of view on remote work.

0:14:28.020,0:14:33.500
And you know, I'm somewhat ambivalent to remote work.

0:14:33.500,0:14:41.660
I think that it has its benefits for those of us like me who have family in a place that's

0:14:41.660,0:14:50.220
not so techie and it has its huge downsides which we'll also kind of cover.

0:14:50.220,0:14:57.340
So kind of what he went over today was he opposes the work from home policies and called

0:14:57.340,0:15:01.460
out remote work and said it was morally wrong.

0:15:01.460,0:15:06.500
He suggested that work from home policies are fundamentally unfair since every employee

0:15:06.500,0:15:13.900
can work from home, pointing to a factory and food workers.

0:15:13.900,0:15:22.220
So basically what he's saying is there are kind of, I don't know if you want to call

0:15:22.220,0:15:28.160
them elites, who can work from home, people like me, who have a job that pretty much is

0:15:28.160,0:15:29.880
all done on the web.

0:15:29.880,0:15:38.080
And then you have the other part of the society who are equally important in holding up the

0:15:38.080,0:15:44.140
society and producing food and working in factories and keeping everything we enjoy

0:15:44.140,0:15:45.920
afloat.

0:15:45.920,0:15:51.840
And there is an unfairness to that and it could cause social tension, I think, is his

0:15:51.840,0:15:56.340
perspective on this.

0:15:56.340,0:16:02.540
He mentioned Amazon and Apple want their employees to go back to office, which is true.

0:16:02.540,0:16:09.480
Game companies like Blizzard and Microsoft want that as well.

0:16:09.480,0:16:14.120
And it's kind of a big push to get back to office.

0:16:14.120,0:16:19.120
For employees, the remote work benefits are obvious.

0:16:19.120,0:16:23.560
And that's kind of what was said.

0:16:23.560,0:16:26.640
That's like a quick summary of what was said in that.

0:16:26.640,0:16:35.600
Now my perspective on remote work, I know that I have a bias, but I also understand

0:16:35.600,0:16:36.840
this point of view.

0:16:36.840,0:16:40.800
I understand the unfairness factor to society.

0:16:40.800,0:16:48.760
Of course, there's always been a disparity between, say, programmers who sit and don't

0:16:48.760,0:16:51.320
have to do much.

0:16:51.320,0:16:56.400
We're not lifting heavy weights or heavy things and risking our lives like other people are

0:16:56.400,0:16:57.560
doing.

0:16:57.560,0:16:58.960
And then other people do that.

0:16:58.960,0:17:01.600
And somehow programmers get paid more.

0:17:01.600,0:17:09.720
And it all comes down to capitalism, supply and demand.

0:17:09.720,0:17:14.720
For example, if computers just died today, I'd probably be able to pick up and learn

0:17:14.720,0:17:19.800
construction or something like that as long as I'm mobile and able.

0:17:19.800,0:17:22.720
And that's not so easy.

0:17:22.720,0:17:26.000
If all the lumber in the world disappeared and all we had were computers, it would be

0:17:26.000,0:17:32.200
much more difficult for someone in construction to take a role that I work in.

0:17:32.200,0:17:37.120
And that's not to say one is harder than the other or anything like that.

0:17:37.120,0:17:39.080
That's just how capitalism works.

0:17:39.080,0:17:41.520
It's a supply and demand scenario.

0:17:41.520,0:17:47.400
And it can be unfair, but it's created the greatest nation in the world and the greatest

0:17:47.400,0:17:52.880
prosperity that the world has ever seen because we do share a lot of our prosperity.

0:17:52.880,0:17:55.160
So it's unfortunate.

0:17:55.160,0:17:56.760
I have no solution.

0:17:56.760,0:18:00.120
I have no opinion on a solution.

0:18:00.120,0:18:03.120
I'm just a family man who wants to feed his kids.

0:18:03.120,0:18:11.600
So from the perspective of working from home, I've worked with a lot of people who work

0:18:11.600,0:18:13.480
from home for the last couple of years.

0:18:13.480,0:18:22.760
I mean, my job all the way up till 2020 was going to the office and I would take a train

0:18:22.760,0:18:27.560
two hours to get there and two hours back because I wanted to live in a different place

0:18:27.560,0:18:32.140
than the job was or it was way too expensive to live where the job was.

0:18:32.140,0:18:38.280
So I sacrificed four hours of my day, five days a week just to get to and from work.

0:18:38.280,0:18:46.880
And I was on trains where people on the train before me were attacked by people with machetes.

0:18:46.880,0:18:50.320
And I've seen quite a few weird things on the train.

0:18:50.320,0:18:56.940
So I prefer not to do that, especially now that I have children.

0:18:56.940,0:19:06.080
So there is like a rah-rah and a lot of people who are remote work, working from home, they

0:19:06.080,0:19:09.920
have this like, let's band together and not allow it to happen.

0:19:09.920,0:19:14.080
Now I would like to say if you could make yourself valuable.

0:19:14.080,0:19:16.480
Now this is the same thing between programmers.

0:19:16.480,0:19:22.840
So you have a value hierarchy of supply and demand within programmers.

0:19:22.840,0:19:31.400
You have programmers who there's a lot of supply and the demand is met.

0:19:31.400,0:19:38.240
But then you have jobs that are much higher difficulty that have a very low supply of

0:19:38.240,0:19:42.920
programmers and has a very high demand.

0:19:42.920,0:19:50.400
Now I would argue that if there's a huge supply of programmers for a particular job, then

0:19:50.400,0:19:55.360
a company may be in their rights to say, come into work.

0:19:55.360,0:19:58.740
And that's because you don't really have arguing power there.

0:19:58.740,0:20:01.480
You don't, you can't fight for your position.

0:20:01.480,0:20:03.740
You can't do something like that.

0:20:03.740,0:20:09.520
Now programmers who are in much lower supply, let's say they're a systems programmer, game

0:20:09.520,0:20:16.100
engine programmers, those sorts of people, you have bargaining power.

0:20:16.100,0:20:19.640
It's hard to find people in that realm.

0:20:19.640,0:20:23.200
And you could say, hey, I'll take a little bit of a pay cut.

0:20:23.200,0:20:26.240
Let me work exclusively from home.

0:20:26.240,0:20:28.040
And we've got a deal.

0:20:28.040,0:20:29.880
And companies would gladly do that.

0:20:29.880,0:20:36.120
And they even before the whole pandemic, people would have, companies would have gladly done

0:20:36.120,0:20:37.120
it.

0:20:37.120,0:20:39.460
I've worked with people who worked remote.

0:20:39.460,0:20:48.320
So I think just on the perspective of remote work, there is, you know, you don't have a

0:20:48.320,0:20:51.400
right to just want to do it your way.

0:20:51.400,0:20:54.120
And the reason I say this is because I've worked with a lot of programmers who work

0:20:54.120,0:20:57.040
remote who don't do much of anything.

0:20:57.040,0:21:02.800
They, I know they came in late, came in late.

0:21:02.800,0:21:03.800
They push off things.

0:21:03.800,0:21:08.720
They go to a lot of meetings and just work doesn't get done.

0:21:08.720,0:21:12.960
And you can tell because timelines get pushed all the time.

0:21:12.960,0:21:18.680
And part of that is the hierarchy of the business, you know, management and all that stuff and

0:21:18.680,0:21:20.080
having too many programmers.

0:21:20.080,0:21:25.760
And that's a whole other thing to, to, to look at.

0:21:25.760,0:21:30.320
Now one thing I will say is I do miss working in person.

0:21:30.320,0:21:31.880
It is something that I do miss.

0:21:31.880,0:21:37.280
I actually liked going in and the camaraderie and, you know, making the jokes and eating

0:21:37.280,0:21:43.080
with the, eating with the coworkers and talking about code and projects and concepts and ideas

0:21:43.080,0:21:47.560
and game designs and hunting and just random stuff.

0:21:47.560,0:21:48.560
I do miss that.

0:21:48.560,0:21:50.800
And, you know, the free lunches were awesome too.

0:21:50.800,0:21:52.840
You get free lunch every day.

0:21:52.840,0:21:55.360
Those, those were great, a great incentive.

0:21:55.360,0:22:00.360
So there were definitely huge perks that I really miss.

0:22:00.360,0:22:05.180
Now as a father, I love being at home with my kids.

0:22:05.180,0:22:08.680
So working remote is a dream come true.

0:22:08.680,0:22:14.960
I, the time that I would spend traveling to go to work to come from work can be spent

0:22:14.960,0:22:16.720
with my children.

0:22:16.720,0:22:22.200
And really there's, that's, there's no, there's nothing that compares.

0:22:22.200,0:22:23.520
It's it's the dream.

0:22:23.520,0:22:29.880
So though I do miss the social aspect of talking to people and that does, you know, is a downside.

0:22:29.880,0:22:33.920
There is an upside to being with my family.

0:22:33.920,0:22:35.520
You gotta pay somewhere.

0:22:35.520,0:22:37.240
You can't get everything for free.

0:22:37.240,0:22:43.600
Now people who don't have families, I'm sorry, but you know, I would even encourage you to

0:22:43.600,0:22:44.600
go to work.

0:22:44.600,0:22:47.260
Staying at home all day is not good for your mental health.

0:22:47.260,0:22:52.120
If you don't have families, even if you just have a wife and you don't have kids, it's

0:22:52.120,0:22:57.000
not good for you just to be at home all day, locked in a room, same room every day, nobody

0:22:57.000,0:22:58.440
around you.

0:22:58.440,0:22:59.840
That's that's not healthy.

0:22:59.840,0:23:06.280
And I would say try maybe, you know, going into work when they have those, uh, they have,

0:23:06.280,0:23:10.560
uh, pretty much every job has open desks for you to go in and work.

0:23:10.560,0:23:15.040
The problem there is if nobody else is there, then you're just in a bigger room alone and

0:23:15.040,0:23:16.800
you had to travel to get there.

0:23:16.800,0:23:22.680
So there is kind of an incentive in that way for companies to request people to come into

0:23:22.680,0:23:28.500
work so that people can see each other so that it gives incentive to people who want

0:23:28.500,0:23:32.460
to come in, maybe not all the time to come in.

0:23:32.460,0:23:33.920
It's a very difficult situation.

0:23:33.920,0:23:38.320
I understand the perspective as a work from home person who does not want to change it

0:23:38.320,0:23:41.160
because I have children.

0:23:41.160,0:23:44.920
I will say though, if I didn't have children, I'd be going back to work.

0:23:44.920,0:23:46.400
I would actually be going in.

0:23:46.400,0:23:48.960
I would probably get a different job that was closer to me.

0:23:48.960,0:23:54.760
So I didn't spend four hours traveling, but I would likely go into work, uh, because I

0:23:54.760,0:24:01.920
just, I love that social atmosphere of being with like-minded people working together,

0:24:01.920,0:24:02.920
that sort of thing.

0:24:02.920,0:24:04.040
It's, I just miss it.

0:24:04.040,0:24:08.200
So really the only reason I don't is my kids.

0:24:08.200,0:24:13.420
So that's, that's kind of the two sides of the coin.

0:24:13.420,0:24:18.960
I feel the upsides, like I said previously of working from home for, even for people

0:24:18.960,0:24:24.000
without kids are obvious, uh, lower cost of living.

0:24:24.000,0:24:32.480
For example, I lived in a high cost area and in 2020 I moved back to be with family and

0:24:32.480,0:24:37.520
just my entire, you know, extended family, uh, were really close.

0:24:37.520,0:24:44.640
So by doing that, my cost of living went way down and that was a huge benefit to me and

0:24:44.640,0:24:47.560
made it much more comfortable to raise my children.

0:24:47.560,0:24:52.360
Um, and to know that I could provide for them a home and everything else.

0:24:52.360,0:24:59.480
So there's just so many benefits from working from home.

0:24:59.480,0:25:07.680
Um, but I do get it and employees are not as productive as they could be in office.

0:25:07.680,0:25:13.400
This is why, if you remember before 2020, um, we work was booming.

0:25:13.400,0:25:18.200
I think it's dead now because of everything that happened, but it was booming because

0:25:18.200,0:25:25.160
people would leave home to rent a space in an office, even if it was by themselves, if

0:25:25.160,0:25:30.320
they're video editors or whatever, just because they made them more productive or maybe it

0:25:30.320,0:25:31.480
made them feel more productive.

0:25:31.480,0:25:38.080
I don't know, but I think going to have a space to work at, especially with others does

0:25:38.080,0:25:40.480
make you more productive in general.

0:25:40.480,0:25:42.840
It's a lot easier to talk to people.

0:25:42.840,0:25:47.760
Now at my last company, what we did is we had a discord channel and we had a, uh, kind

0:25:47.760,0:25:52.240
of a structure that segmented the programmers into five groups.

0:25:52.240,0:25:55.800
And my group would be in discord all day long and we had pushed to talk.

0:25:55.800,0:25:57.280
So we'd press a button and talk.

0:25:57.280,0:26:00.800
And it was kind of like being in the office because there was a lot of banter.

0:26:00.800,0:26:02.240
We made some jokes.

0:26:02.240,0:26:08.320
We made, you know, as, as employer, as employees do with each other, made inappropriate jokes,

0:26:08.320,0:26:12.560
made, uh, just, just had, you know, shooting the breeze and having a lot of fun.

0:26:12.560,0:26:17.380
But we also did of course, use that to talk about random problems.

0:26:17.380,0:26:23.400
So there wasn't a meeting barrier, uh, where we'd have to set up a meeting to talk about

0:26:23.400,0:26:24.400
something.

0:26:24.400,0:26:27.280
We just press a button and say, Hey, yo, you know, I have this problem.

0:26:27.280,0:26:29.440
You guys seen it, you guys know what's going on.

0:26:29.440,0:26:30.440
And they would just respond.

0:26:30.440,0:26:32.280
It was very simple.

0:26:32.280,0:26:35.000
Uh, also meetings, I think exploded.

0:26:35.000,0:26:36.920
I don't even want to get into meetings.

0:26:36.920,0:26:41.200
Anyone who has a job in programming knows meetings are useless.

0:26:41.200,0:26:47.300
Uh, I think it's just a pad the hours of the day and people, uh, they say, oh, I hate meetings

0:26:47.300,0:26:52.080
but then the, they make the meetings go really long because they don't want to get back to

0:26:52.080,0:26:53.080
work.

0:26:53.080,0:26:55.840
Uh, you know, get back to work.

0:26:55.840,0:27:01.680
Uh, they want to be able to go into the standup the next day and say, oh, you know, I had

0:27:01.680,0:27:05.360
meetings for this and that and that and this other meeting and, you know, meetings all

0:27:05.360,0:27:06.360
day.

0:27:06.360,0:27:08.080
So it was really hard to get anything done.

0:27:08.080,0:27:11.920
Um, that's, that's common.

0:27:11.920,0:27:14.040
It's not as common as my current job.

0:27:14.040,0:27:16.560
My last job, super common.

0:27:16.560,0:27:22.640
Their job I think is a lot more, um, streamlined and they're, they're pretty effective at kind

0:27:22.640,0:27:27.760
of managing those meetings, at least for me, others maybe not, but at least for me and

0:27:27.760,0:27:30.140
the one I work at has tons of remote workers.

0:27:30.140,0:27:32.760
They hire tons of people knowing they're out of state.

0:27:32.760,0:27:39.920
Even, uh, I'm out of state and you know, everybody on my, on the engine team is out of state

0:27:39.920,0:27:41.920
from the actual office.

0:27:41.920,0:27:47.920
So I think they've just, they're much more educated and well-versed in how to work with,

0:27:47.920,0:27:52.940
uh, work with remote people, manage the time and get things done.

0:27:52.940,0:27:55.920
So it is kind of up to the business.

0:27:55.920,0:27:59.000
If it's a big business, it's hard to do that.

0:27:59.000,0:28:03.000
So at big businesses, you're going to see big businesses calling people in the, at the

0:28:03.000,0:28:08.400
more medium sized ones, uh, you know, or sub studios, you're probably going to see a lot

0:28:08.400,0:28:09.960
more remote work.

0:28:09.960,0:28:15.200
So that's my long rant on remote work.

0:28:15.200,0:28:23.160
And like I said, it has emotional health, uh, benefits and negatives.

0:28:23.160,0:28:27.080
I think there's a lot of benefits for families, people with children.

0:28:27.080,0:28:32.200
I think that there's a lot of negatives for people who are just, you know, I don't want

0:28:32.200,0:28:36.840
to say alone, but you know, they, they're not married or they don't have kids.

0:28:36.840,0:28:40.240
Maybe their spouse goes somewhere else to work or their spouse is just in another room

0:28:40.240,0:28:41.240
all day.

0:28:41.240,0:28:45.120
I can see there being some, you know, severe downsides.

0:28:45.120,0:28:46.120
People are social.

0:28:46.120,0:28:47.120
We want to talk.

0:28:47.120,0:28:53.480
Um, you know, I talked to my son who can't really make a full, he can't even make a full

0:28:53.480,0:28:56.200
sentence, but there's a lot of social to that.

0:28:56.200,0:29:00.640
And I play with him and you know, it it's, I think I fill my social meter if we're talking

0:29:00.640,0:29:04.040
about the Sims, uh, pretty effectively with that.

0:29:04.040,0:29:09.440
So yeah, that's, that's kind of the perspective on remote work.

0:29:09.440,0:29:13.640
If you're a remote worker, get on a good for you.

0:29:13.640,0:29:19.480
But um, you know, I'm, I'm not into the whole rah, rah, let's rally together and never let

0:29:19.480,0:29:24.600
a, never let them make us, uh, come into the office ever again.

0:29:24.600,0:29:30.680
I think that there are huge benefits to be in the office, um, and a lot of scenarios

0:29:30.680,0:29:36.520
and a, you got to choose your battles and you've got to have the skills that are worth,

0:29:36.520,0:29:40.640
uh, worth it to the company to argue for remote work in my opinion.

0:29:40.640,0:29:45.640
So that's, that's the perspective on remote work.

0:29:45.640,0:29:53.320
Alright, due to there not being a whole lot of news today I suppose, everybody is talking

0:29:53.320,0:29:59.800
about Sega raising its price to $70 for games.

0:29:59.800,0:30:07.080
Now I have heard the argument, games have been the same price for many many years.

0:30:07.080,0:30:09.200
Uh huh, I hear ya.

0:30:09.200,0:30:17.080
I mean it has raised $10 once before and $10 again, I hear that argument.

0:30:17.080,0:30:23.640
It would be a valid argument if all the methods of distribution were exactly the same.

0:30:23.640,0:30:27.920
The difference is that all the methods of distribution have changed.

0:30:27.920,0:30:29.560
A lot of people buy digital.

0:30:29.560,0:30:33.680
I would probably think that most people buy digital.

0:30:33.680,0:30:44.640
Just look at Steam sales and those digital sales still being full box price is crazy

0:30:44.640,0:30:45.640
to me.

0:30:45.640,0:30:47.400
It's crazy that the price is so high.

0:30:47.400,0:30:52.200
It's crazy that we're going to $70, we're going to be at like $100 soon.

0:30:52.200,0:31:00.520
I get that there's inflation and the whole economy thing that's going haywire, but still

0:31:00.520,0:31:06.960
the $70 for a game, that's a lot of money for people.

0:31:06.960,0:31:14.360
You can imagine everybody from kids who just started working, who left their parents' house,

0:31:14.360,0:31:19.960
maybe they're starting their career and they're starting to work and develop their skills,

0:31:19.960,0:31:22.480
they want to go home and play games too.

0:31:22.480,0:31:28.880
You're kind of limiting them to buying one game a year or something like that.

0:31:28.880,0:31:33.640
You can't buy that many AAA games at $70 a pop in those scenarios.

0:31:33.640,0:31:40.640
I know because I had a minimum wage job to start and I couldn't even buy ice cream.

0:31:40.640,0:31:46.960
So in that scenario I'd have to save $70 somehow because I had rent and everything else to

0:31:46.960,0:31:50.600
pay so I wouldn't even be able to buy AAA games.

0:31:50.600,0:31:52.040
I've got to wait until they go on sale.

0:31:52.040,0:31:56.800
But then you have companies like Nintendo that just don't go on sale for whatever reason.

0:31:56.800,0:32:02.040
And since they never go on sale and they keep their games at their top price, even when

0:32:02.040,0:32:08.120
you want to buy used, you're paying like $52.

0:32:08.120,0:32:09.120
That's insane.

0:32:09.120,0:32:14.640
How are you going to play any of these games you really want to play in that perspective?

0:32:14.640,0:32:16.840
It's unheard of.

0:32:16.840,0:32:20.320
So raising it to $70, that's a $10 jump.

0:32:20.320,0:32:22.840
You have digital distribution.

0:32:22.840,0:32:29.440
It does not cost you the same that it would cost you to put a box on the shelf of a store

0:32:29.440,0:32:33.320
because you have to make all that box art, you have to produce it, you have to publish

0:32:33.320,0:32:39.120
it, you have to work with the warehouses and shipping and distribution and overseas shipping

0:32:39.120,0:32:42.340
and all of that sort of stuff.

0:32:42.340,0:32:43.400
You don't have to do that anymore.

0:32:43.400,0:32:45.720
You just click a button and download it.

0:32:45.720,0:32:49.640
And server space is cheap, man.

0:32:49.640,0:32:53.400
So many cloud providers competing in the space, it's cheap.

0:32:53.400,0:32:54.400
They're cheap.

0:32:54.400,0:32:58.600
Especially when you buy it at scale, it's incredibly cheap.

0:32:58.600,0:33:09.360
So going up to $70 for games, I feel like it's a real shame because I remember myself

0:33:09.360,0:33:14.920
in that scenario and this would have just made it so I couldn't play any games at all.

0:33:14.920,0:33:20.840
I'd have to play like the throwaway sports games that everybody has.

0:33:20.840,0:33:24.400
As a game collector, and if any of you collect games, you know exactly what I'm talking about,

0:33:24.400,0:33:28.960
the wall of sports games would be like all you could afford.

0:33:28.960,0:33:37.560
So I think another problem why the prices have gone up is the same thing with the companies.

0:33:37.560,0:33:39.440
They overstaff.

0:33:39.440,0:33:40.840
They over budget.

0:33:40.840,0:33:47.880
They spend way too much time managing and meetings and planning and JIRA and tasks and

0:33:47.880,0:33:51.720
all this sort of nonsense.

0:33:51.720,0:33:59.200
They waste so much money and hire way too many people to make a video game.

0:33:59.200,0:34:04.600
I can't compare games now to games from the 90s where you had like five dudes working

0:34:04.600,0:34:08.480
on it at Nintendo and they'd produce a hit title.

0:34:08.480,0:34:12.640
Of course, games are way more complicated now.

0:34:12.640,0:34:15.480
There's way more to them and there's a lot of higher expectations.

0:34:15.480,0:34:18.080
I get that.

0:34:18.080,0:34:24.060
But at the same time, back then they had to make their own tools to make it work.

0:34:24.060,0:34:30.200
Now you've got Unity, you've got Unreal Engine, you can do motion capture with pretty cheap

0:34:30.200,0:34:31.200
equipment now.

0:34:31.200,0:34:36.000
It's super cheap to do motion capture, to set up a motion capture studio.

0:34:36.000,0:34:43.320
Studios that work that just have one and just to have one or whenever they need it.

0:34:43.320,0:34:46.640
It's really inexpensive nowadays.

0:34:46.640,0:34:50.920
We're not talking like 50 grand to set up a mocap studio.

0:34:50.920,0:34:58.600
People can set up mocap with, I remember like six or almost, yeah, six or ten years ago,

0:34:58.600,0:35:06.200
somewhere in there, people were getting a whole bunch of, what are they called, the

0:35:06.200,0:35:07.200
Microsoft Kinect.

0:35:07.200,0:35:10.720
They're getting a whole bunch of those and you get like three or five of them and you

0:35:10.720,0:35:12.560
connect them together.

0:35:12.560,0:35:18.000
And you had a mocap basically that you sure had to clean up, but what mocap don't you

0:35:18.000,0:35:19.840
have to clean up?

0:35:19.840,0:35:22.560
And it's way cheaper now.

0:35:22.560,0:35:25.440
So it's way cheaper to produce.

0:35:25.440,0:35:27.160
You have all these tools made for you.

0:35:27.160,0:35:32.080
You don't need crazy, you don't need an army of engine programmers.

0:35:32.080,0:35:37.960
You just kind of, you know, you need game programmers and they use the tools that pre-exist

0:35:37.960,0:35:39.600
in the engine.

0:35:39.600,0:35:42.840
You have tons of tools from online.

0:35:42.840,0:35:47.960
You've got all the third party tools like Blender is free even.

0:35:47.960,0:35:53.960
You have Affinity or Adobe Photoshop and all that sort of stuff.

0:35:53.960,0:35:55.560
And you have AI now.

0:35:55.560,0:35:58.760
You have libraries of PBR materials.

0:35:58.760,0:36:03.400
Just so much stuff to accelerate your process.

0:36:03.400,0:36:10.520
Being in games, at least in the last company, it took us way too many years to develop a

0:36:10.520,0:36:14.560
game and that's because we remade it multiple times because it wasn't feeling right.

0:36:14.560,0:36:16.740
It wasn't hitting the KPIs.

0:36:16.740,0:36:22.840
So in that part, it's kind of your problem, the business problem to figure out.

0:36:22.840,0:36:26.520
And maybe with less people, you would have a more clear direction.

0:36:26.520,0:36:32.640
So $70 for a game, man, that's a tough bullet to bite, especially for me.

0:36:32.640,0:36:35.720
I can tell you right now, I have children.

0:36:35.720,0:36:38.800
I'm not going to be spending $70 on a game.

0:36:38.800,0:36:45.440
I will wait until that game goes on sale at my local game stores and I will buy it much

0:36:45.440,0:36:47.080
cheaper or I'll buy it on eBay.

0:36:47.080,0:36:52.020
I will not buy top dollar, $70 games.

0:36:52.020,0:36:56.280
Like the Legend of Zelda is out right now and I really want to play it.

0:36:56.280,0:36:58.920
First of all, I'm about to have a kid, so I can't.

0:36:58.920,0:37:05.880
But even so, I would much rather just wait some number of months to get it at a reasonable

0:37:05.880,0:37:06.880
price.

0:37:06.880,0:37:10.280
$70 is way too much.

0:37:10.280,0:37:15.440
That's like how much money I spend at the grocery store buying like five things.

0:37:15.440,0:37:20.800
So would I rather eat or would I rather play a game?

0:37:20.800,0:37:23.800
I'm going to choose to eat, sorry.

0:37:23.800,0:37:34.240
So hopefully people fight this and they just, I don't know, stop buying $70 games or just

0:37:34.240,0:37:39.280
only buy games on sales or third party because that's crazy.

0:37:39.280,0:37:41.520
That's crazy towns.

0:37:41.520,0:37:47.000
But companies Activision, Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Take-Two Interactive, which owns a lot

0:37:47.000,0:37:54.360
of companies by the way, PlayStation, Xbox, and even Nintendo have all raised their prices

0:37:54.360,0:38:01.840
and so and Sega now have all raised their prices to $70 and it's a shame.

0:38:01.840,0:38:03.080
That's my opinions on that.

0:38:03.080,0:38:05.920
If you have a strong opinion on it, let me know.

0:38:05.920,0:38:10.960
Maybe a counter argument and let me know why we should be paying $70 rather than companies

0:38:10.960,0:38:17.040
kind of fixing their staffing problem and all their other problems to reduce the cost

0:38:17.040,0:38:22.120
for them so that they can pass those savings on to the consumer.

0:38:22.120,0:38:23.520
That's my thoughts on that.

0:38:23.520,0:38:30.500
All right, so I'm going to wrap this up with a couple of shorter things.

0:38:30.500,0:38:35.280
So one is the Nintendo 64 controller for the Switch is now available.

0:38:35.280,0:38:39.920
I mention this because I missed out on it last time it sold out.

0:38:39.920,0:38:44.920
I missed out on the Super Nintendo controller and I bought both of those just now.

0:38:44.920,0:38:53.880
So I do want to play the emulator games on the Switch using the controllers I remember

0:38:53.880,0:38:55.080
from my childhood.

0:38:55.080,0:38:58.960
So that's going to be exciting.

0:38:58.960,0:39:03.980
If they're still in stock by the time this goes up tomorrow, tomorrow morning, hopefully

0:39:03.980,0:39:08.960
you can grab one if you also missed it.

0:39:08.960,0:39:17.520
And another topic that is near and dear to my heart is that Overwatch has canceled their

0:39:17.520,0:39:20.080
PvE hero mode.

0:39:20.080,0:39:21.480
And that sucks.

0:39:21.480,0:39:24.560
I mean, I'm pretty sure that's going to make tons of people angry.

0:39:24.560,0:39:29.440
Now, I haven't played Overwatch in some number of months now.

0:39:29.440,0:39:30.800
I was an avid player.

0:39:30.800,0:39:32.720
I've played it ever since it launched.

0:39:32.720,0:39:38.820
I have an Overwatch 2 poster that's signed by the developers because I loved playing

0:39:38.820,0:39:45.560
it so much, even with all its quirks and its biases and its angry players and all of those

0:39:45.560,0:39:47.480
sorts of things.

0:39:47.480,0:39:48.480
I loved Overwatch.

0:39:48.480,0:39:50.480
I loved the characters.

0:39:50.480,0:39:54.400
Didn't care much about the stories that they put out.

0:39:54.400,0:39:56.040
I'm not super into stories for games.

0:39:56.040,0:40:04.740
I also don't like it when they retcon a whole bunch of stuff just to please people.

0:40:04.740,0:40:07.960
So I just didn't pay attention to the story, but the gameplay was awesome.

0:40:07.960,0:40:13.200
The character, like the way the different characters would play, it was just a lot of

0:40:13.200,0:40:14.200
fun.

0:40:14.200,0:40:15.320
It was fun to play the characters.

0:40:15.320,0:40:17.520
Their character controllers were awesome.

0:40:17.520,0:40:24.280
Their networking, for some of its flaws, was pretty dang good, or is pretty dang good.

0:40:24.280,0:40:30.800
So I was super hyped about the PvE mode for Overwatch.

0:40:30.800,0:40:33.640
I don't know who else was.

0:40:33.640,0:40:41.720
I've played so much competitive matches and arcade modes that I was ready for a PvE mode,

0:40:41.720,0:40:47.600
something where you can have a character, you can essentially level them up, play with

0:40:47.600,0:40:50.040
other people, play with friends, randos, doesn't matter.

0:40:50.040,0:40:54.840
I thought it would be a lot less toxic.

0:40:54.840,0:40:59.480
If you've ever played competitive or any other part of Overwatch, you know it's crazy toxic.

0:40:59.480,0:41:03.560
You can be getting along with somebody just fine, one mistake and it's over.

0:41:03.560,0:41:04.560
They're just pissed.

0:41:04.560,0:41:07.920
They're just going to yell at you and they're going to scream and they're going to say,

0:41:07.920,0:41:10.600
it's all, I don't know, choose a character.

0:41:10.600,0:41:14.200
They're going to blame somebody.

0:41:14.200,0:41:18.400
They always blame somebody else, somebody but themselves.

0:41:18.400,0:41:23.160
Being a team game, if you're not being a team player, it's probably you.

0:41:23.160,0:41:29.920
But I don't know, the matches where you clicked with people and you had fun, and even if they

0:41:29.920,0:41:34.480
were close matches and you lost or whatever and people were still cool about it, that's

0:41:34.480,0:41:36.960
what I liked and it felt really good with that.

0:41:36.960,0:41:39.040
And I thought the PvE would be that.

0:41:39.040,0:41:45.880
I thought it would be that experience that I enjoyed so much from the online play, playing

0:41:45.880,0:41:54.120
with people who just were having fun and could cooperate and were just enjoying the game

0:41:54.120,0:41:57.920
and nobody was being toxic.

0:41:57.920,0:42:01.120
I thought that was going to be just amazing.

0:42:01.120,0:42:06.600
So they scrapped that and of course that probably means I won't play anytime soon anymore.

0:42:06.600,0:42:11.160
Like I said, I haven't been playing for a few months, but if they said, oh, PvE is launching

0:42:11.160,0:42:20.080
in a month, I would be right back into Overwatch, getting prepared after my new kid is born.

0:42:20.080,0:42:31.080
And man, that would have brought me back so fast, but man, it's just, I'm so disappointed.

0:42:31.080,0:42:33.200
That's the hard part is that I'm not angry.

0:42:33.200,0:42:39.600
I'm just disappointed because the game was great and I thought this would be so awesome.

0:42:39.600,0:42:43.480
You know, with all the team swapping and stuff they did internally at Blizzard, I can see

0:42:43.480,0:42:45.400
how these kinds of things happen.

0:42:45.400,0:42:51.080
Being on teams of programmers and game developers who've had that sort of thing happen in the

0:42:51.080,0:42:53.160
past, I get it.

0:42:53.160,0:42:54.160
Totally get it.

0:42:54.160,0:42:58.440
The developers themselves are probably super disappointed.

0:42:58.440,0:43:01.960
At the end of the day, it's a business, they've got to make money.

0:43:01.960,0:43:04.480
And the live services is what makes their money.

0:43:04.480,0:43:09.440
So super disappointed in that.

0:43:09.440,0:43:11.340
So that's a random topic on games.

0:43:11.340,0:43:15.720
And now to throw out something for the programmers.

0:43:15.720,0:43:22.520
This is going to be for the much more advanced programmers, for those of you who are interested

0:43:22.520,0:43:28.680
in multi-threaded applications and verifying your code.

0:43:28.680,0:43:39.160
If you haven't used, I guess it's a language, it's a logic checker, it's called TLA+, it's

0:43:39.160,0:43:40.920
been around for quite a while.

0:43:40.920,0:43:45.200
I'm a huge fan of the guy who made it.

0:43:45.200,0:43:46.840
Just him personally.

0:43:46.840,0:43:51.640
I can't remember his name off the top of my head.

0:43:51.640,0:43:53.240
I'm going to have to look it up.

0:43:53.240,0:43:59.240
But he works on algorithms.

0:43:59.240,0:44:01.320
He's a mathematician in the background.

0:44:01.320,0:44:07.120
Let's see, who made TLA+.

0:44:07.120,0:44:11.600
So he comes from this algorithms background.

0:44:11.600,0:44:21.440
And his focus was primarily on multi-threaded applications or intercommunication between

0:44:21.440,0:44:23.280
computers, parallel computing.

0:44:23.280,0:44:26.520
Leslie Lamport, how could I forget?

0:44:26.520,0:44:27.620
LL.

0:44:27.620,0:44:32.400
So TLA is a way for you to check your multi-threaded code.

0:44:32.400,0:44:37.840
I think it's kind of the root, his favorite algorithm that he came up with, the root of

0:44:37.840,0:44:41.080
it goes back to the bakery algorithm.

0:44:41.080,0:44:43.360
And I'll leave that to you to look up.

0:44:43.360,0:44:46.400
It basically has to do with a man going into the bakery and getting a ticket.

0:44:46.400,0:44:51.160
And there's a bunch of people with tickets and it's like a multi-threading program.

0:44:51.160,0:44:54.120
And it's an algorithm to solve that problem.

0:44:54.120,0:44:59.320
But TLA+, if you haven't used it, you should use it.

0:44:59.320,0:45:00.800
There's a funny story about it.

0:45:00.800,0:45:06.600
He works at Microsoft and Microsoft didn't start using it internally, rigorously until

0:45:06.600,0:45:13.360
Amazon published that they were using it and was making their web services so much better.

0:45:13.360,0:45:18.920
And if you're doing web stuff, if you're doing multi-threaded programming, check out TLA+.

0:45:18.920,0:45:24.220
It does use logic notation from mathematics.

0:45:24.220,0:45:25.600
It's in ASCII form.

0:45:25.600,0:45:30.800
So if you're going to do like an and or or, you've got to use the forward slash, back

0:45:30.800,0:45:35.820
slash to make the shape to do the logic.

0:45:35.820,0:45:39.600
But learning logic notation is not that complicated.

0:45:39.600,0:45:40.680
Just look it up on Wikipedia.

0:45:40.680,0:45:43.160
It's a pretty short read.

0:45:43.160,0:45:48.840
And I would highly suggest if you haven't used TLA+, this is a PSA, you don't see a

0:45:48.840,0:45:49.840
whole lot on it.

0:45:49.840,0:45:52.640
I would like you to check it out.

0:45:52.640,0:46:01.160
And I'll put the link to an article that I saw recently that got me thinking about it

0:46:01.160,0:46:04.920
that kind of talks about the two-phase pizza party.

0:46:04.920,0:46:10.560
And there's a step, I think it explains, I haven't read through the whole thing, but

0:46:10.560,0:46:16.200
it looks like it explains TLA+, in a basic way, to learn it.

0:46:16.200,0:46:18.840
So I'm going to be posting that in the description.

0:46:18.840,0:46:23.240
I'll put it on the Twitter, and go check it out if you're into multithreaded stuff, if

0:46:23.240,0:46:27.480
you're learning multithreaded stuff, if you do web things, check it out.

0:46:27.480,0:46:33.680
It's going to make your algorithms better, and it's going to help you a lot in solving

0:46:33.680,0:46:35.840
problems before they happen.

0:46:35.840,0:46:40.480
Lots of problems happen with concurrency on the web, and this is a great way to solve

0:46:40.480,0:46:41.640
that.

0:46:41.640,0:46:43.200
So that's it for today.

0:46:43.200,0:46:48.360
I know it was a lot of rant about jobs, but there's been a lot of things going on about

0:46:48.360,0:46:49.360
it.

0:46:49.360,0:46:52.200
There was that interview with Elon Musk, it really got me thinking about it.

0:46:52.200,0:46:54.640
And those are my perspectives on that.

0:46:54.640,0:46:57.560
I'd like to hear your perspectives, if you have any, how you feel.

0:46:57.560,0:47:02.800
I'm sure most of you have been doing remote work as developers, and I want to know what

0:47:02.800,0:47:09.160
you think, maybe from the perspective of somebody who doesn't have children, and how you feel

0:47:09.160,0:47:10.440
about that.

0:47:10.440,0:47:15.160
Because I remember I started remote work without children, and I thought it was the most incredible

0:47:15.160,0:47:19.800
thing in the world, but I don't know what it would be like a few years into it, and

0:47:19.800,0:47:23.960
still being, you know, not flying solo.

0:47:23.960,0:47:28.040
You may have had a girlfriend or wife or whatever, but kind of that aspect of it.

0:47:28.040,0:47:31.320
I'm really curious on your perspective on that, so let me know.

0:47:31.320,0:47:46.600
Anyways, have a good one, and bye for now.
