0:00:00.000,0:00:10.200
Welcome back. Today we've got some really cool looking AI. Look at this stuff. I mean,

0:00:10.200,0:00:15.440
you can put little dots on, it's a little hard to see, there we go, you put little dots

0:00:15.440,0:00:21.840
and you drag them up and it just alters the image. And so there's a lot of like animal

0:00:21.840,0:00:26.880
stuff here, but they go into some other things like here's a car. I mean, it changes the

0:00:26.880,0:00:30.680
car, which is a little odd, but you know, if you make it taller, it has to make sense.

0:00:30.680,0:00:37.680
So a truck makes sense. Rotating cars, they make this horse look like a, like a derpy

0:00:37.680,0:00:46.520
horse. They can close the cat's eyes. This is, this is really cool stuff. So I saw this

0:00:46.520,0:00:55.160
and I just thought it was really neat. It's a great way to, to kind of just, I don't know,

0:00:55.160,0:00:58.960
make an image and then play around with it. It would, it would be incredible. Like here's

0:00:58.960,0:01:03.640
for fashion design. For example, you can see what things look like longer and shorter,

0:01:03.640,0:01:09.900
all this sort of stuff. Pretty cool. What it's called, let's see, it says new AI research

0:01:09.900,0:01:16.200
lets you click and drag on images to manipulate in seconds. It's like Photoshop. It's like

0:01:16.200,0:01:22.480
the Photoshop warp tool, but far more powerful. And I think we just saw why. Sorry to those

0:01:22.480,0:01:26.960
of you who are listening to the podcast. This is really a part you have to see. So maybe

0:01:26.960,0:01:31.560
later on you can check out the video or you can check out on Twitter. I posted a video

0:01:31.560,0:01:39.760
of it. But essentially what's happening is it looks like they're placing a dot and then,

0:01:39.760,0:01:47.720
and then a second dot and then telling the image to warp. And so it changes the imagery,

0:01:47.720,0:01:52.800
moves things around, makes things taller or shorter, changes the time of day, moves like

0:01:52.800,0:02:00.120
people's arms to be in different positions even. So it's, it's a really, really neat

0:02:00.120,0:02:06.640
and powerful tool. I don't know how others feel about this, but I think that it's just

0:02:06.640,0:02:14.600
really neat. I think that it would make for creating images and ideas, kind of concepting

0:02:14.600,0:02:23.360
up stuff really fast and, and effortless. And maybe even take, say, if you have taken

0:02:23.360,0:02:31.160
a photograph and you need to change it so that maybe it just didn't look good, it was

0:02:31.160,0:02:35.880
probably too low or something like that. You can alter your own personal photographs that

0:02:35.880,0:02:44.360
you take to just make them a little more poppy and interesting to look at. Something like

0:02:44.360,0:02:48.560
that. I don't know. I think there's a lot of, a lot of aspects to that, that you can

0:02:48.560,0:02:55.020
just, you could just take and build. Maybe it's for art. If you do, if you've done some

0:02:55.020,0:02:59.320
drawings and you want to see how it looks, if you were to alter it and move it around,

0:02:59.320,0:03:03.240
change their head and rotate it, you can't exactly do that with a drawing. You'd have

0:03:03.240,0:03:08.880
to draw over and over and over again at different perspectives to see how it looks. Whereas

0:03:08.880,0:03:14.120
in this one, you can kind of do like a rough drawing and then alter it, make it, make the

0:03:14.120,0:03:20.760
characters head turn or do stuff with the background and then really kind of nail down

0:03:20.760,0:03:24.600
what you want things to look out. So it's kind of like, maybe it's like thumbnailing

0:03:24.600,0:03:31.480
in that way. But I thought this was super exciting to look at. I don't know how far

0:03:31.480,0:03:34.840
along it is. I don't know if it's going to be a public thing. Altering these things in

0:03:34.840,0:03:41.320
real time like this is probably on, you know, a beast machine with tons of, tons of GPUs

0:03:41.320,0:03:47.200
and I don't know, it's probably on some server somewhere with tons of hardware backing it.

0:03:47.200,0:03:55.120
So I don't think something like this is something you would pop on a laptop anytime soon and

0:03:55.120,0:03:59.920
play around with. Maybe on a desktop, it'll be, it'll likely be a little bit slow. I don't

0:03:59.920,0:04:07.560
know. So this is a research project. Obviously all these things are everything AI is research,

0:04:07.560,0:04:13.560
but it's all, it's all brand new and goofing around with stuff. So it's all brand new research

0:04:13.560,0:04:19.200
things. Take a look at it. Tell me what you think. I think it's cool. I've been looking

0:04:19.200,0:04:27.920
at a lot more AI stuff recently. I mean, it's kind of easy to fall into the AI crowd when

0:04:27.920,0:04:32.760
it's all the hype because you could do so many, it touches on so many aspects of life

0:04:32.760,0:04:38.000
right now, which is, I think what caused it, it's really exploding its popularity. It can,

0:04:38.000,0:04:43.320
it can do photographs, it can do stuff with drawings, it can help with animations, it

0:04:43.320,0:04:50.040
can generate backgrounds for say a movie set or something like that. And that's in the

0:04:50.040,0:04:55.800
art realm and then the programming realm, it can generate code, it can check your code,

0:04:55.800,0:05:02.000
it can create unit tests. It can, it can, you can write unit tests that then it implements

0:05:02.000,0:05:09.200
all the functions for in order to satisfy the unit tests, man. And in film, it can generate

0:05:09.200,0:05:16.600
all kinds of maybe, you know, restore old movies or it can generate, you know, a scene

0:05:16.600,0:05:22.280
from a movie you wish to see just to test. It may not look great, but you can at least

0:05:22.280,0:05:28.640
test out concepts and by, by generating these in between scenes or based on the, the overall

0:05:28.640,0:05:36.200
of what you have so far in, you know, in writing, it's a great way to balance ideas off things

0:05:36.200,0:05:40.240
and look up things on the internet for, you could be very, you can be way more specific

0:05:40.240,0:05:46.600
than an internet search. So yeah, I think that the popularity of AI is coming from all

0:05:46.600,0:05:54.540
of the applications. I don't think, I don't think outside of the operating system, we've

0:05:54.540,0:06:02.480
made any sort of software that touches on so many fields all in one go. And so, you

0:06:02.480,0:06:06.480
know, AI is kind of like that boom of the operating system where the operating system

0:06:06.480,0:06:12.240
now you can have software, specialized software that does anything across all of the applications

0:06:12.240,0:06:17.160
you can think of in finance and art and programming and so on and so forth. AI is kind of that

0:06:17.160,0:06:23.240
same operating system level boom where it just touches everything. So everyone's talking

0:06:23.240,0:06:28.640
about it and everyone, everyone kind of sees the benefits of it. And of course a lot of

0:06:28.640,0:06:35.400
people are afraid of it because you know, if we have hackers now that go break into

0:06:35.400,0:06:40.360
sites, we're going to have hackers with AI tools breaking into sites and doing things

0:06:40.360,0:06:47.160
they shouldn't. So of course, you know, there is parts to be concerned, but I don't think

0:06:47.160,0:06:50.720
we should make everything about worrying. There are people out there who's going to

0:06:50.720,0:06:56.320
worry. We should, we should continue to vocalize our concerns with AI and how it integrates

0:06:56.320,0:07:04.160
with our lives and messes things up. And as long as we're vocal, then the, you know, at

0:07:04.160,0:07:10.960
least in a democratic society, the people who are getting elected, they want to please

0:07:10.960,0:07:17.280
the people that are electing them. Otherwise they won't win the race. And that's kind of

0:07:17.280,0:07:23.280
their primary goal in life. So if we all kind of universally continue to vocalize our opinions

0:07:23.280,0:07:27.960
on that, then the other people will do the work and go and get the right guys and, and

0:07:27.960,0:07:33.800
kind of work it out. But of course we've got to do the legwork of vocalizing it. But all

0:07:33.800,0:07:40.120
in all, I'm super excited about what AI brings and seeing stuff like this, this rapid, this

0:07:40.120,0:07:48.200
rapid boom of AI. It seems like, you know, we heard about AI with like the, uh, the Nvidia

0:07:48.200,0:07:53.520
generates people's faces. I think that was like a few years ago and that was insane to

0:07:53.520,0:07:57.600
everybody. Generally people are faces being generated, just the face too. It wasn't like

0:07:57.600,0:08:04.000
the body, it was just the face. And everyone was like, Oh, this is incredible. Craziest

0:08:04.000,0:08:09.800
thing. A couple of years later, you know, it's full autonomous cars. We've got regenerative

0:08:09.800,0:08:15.120
images, regenerative videos, uh, you know, it's search engines powered by it. It is a

0:08:15.120,0:08:19.760
pretty fast jump. And of course that's why people are concerned. It's jumping really

0:08:19.760,0:08:27.480
fast and it is, you know, it's dangerous in the wrong hands. So all in all, I think it's

0:08:27.480,0:08:33.960
awesome. I I'd like to see more things come out of it. Uh, and uh, so yeah, I'm, I'm an

0:08:33.960,0:08:40.240
optimist. I like it. You know, I do understand people who are fearful of it or, or don't

0:08:40.240,0:08:45.160
trust it or anything like that. Of course, our internet is going to be filled with just

0:08:45.160,0:08:50.760
AI talking to each other. People will just stop using the internet because you won't

0:08:50.760,0:08:58.360
know what's AI and what's not. In fact, that's a reality today. So, you know, that's, it's

0:08:58.360,0:09:06.240
also something to think about anyways. Let's uh, let's jump over to another thing, uh,

0:09:06.240,0:09:15.760
related, somewhat related to AI. And that was the Tesla shareholder meeting. Now, I

0:09:15.760,0:09:20.320
don't know how many people watch the Tesla shareholder meeting. I, I didn't know you

0:09:20.320,0:09:26.080
could until I watched it. And so it's not that exciting. I don't suggest people run

0:09:26.080,0:09:31.400
out and watch it, but it has some, some pretty, some pretty cool information inside of it.

0:09:31.400,0:09:37.280
There was, there was an announcement of they're going to be, they're trying to deploy two

0:09:37.280,0:09:42.240
more cars. Cybertruck is expected to come at the end of the year. Of course, that's

0:09:42.240,0:09:47.920
an Elon estimate. So who knows what that means, but they're, they're working on their end

0:09:47.920,0:09:55.160
design and the, they've already started design on two new cars, two, two new vehicles. I

0:09:55.160,0:10:00.560
don't know if they're cars or SUVs or trucks or what. They're probably more in the car

0:10:00.560,0:10:05.400
class because those are the, what sells right now for them. Uh, there's a lot of talk about

0:10:05.400,0:10:11.960
energy and how Tesla is going to be building its own lithium refinery. And, uh, one of

0:10:11.960,0:10:17.480
the really cool parts of it, I think that, um, at least it was cool to me because it

0:10:17.480,0:10:25.840
was news, uh, to me was that they, they're working on this robot. It's a optimist, I

0:10:25.840,0:10:34.400
believe it's called. So they played a flashy video of optimists and it wasn't, it wasn't

0:10:34.400,0:10:39.360
much different than you would see in all of the other robotics videos that came out of

0:10:39.360,0:10:48.320
Boston dynamics or whatever. Um, these are much more humanized, humanized, humanized,

0:10:48.320,0:10:55.560
humanoid, human looking, uh, robots where, you know, they have a strong focus on having

0:10:55.560,0:11:00.640
five fingers and, and looking like a human with legs and arms and all of that sort of

0:11:00.640,0:11:08.480
stuff. Uh, so, and I, I think there's a great deal of application to that because, you know,

0:11:08.480,0:11:18.480
we could build, uh, robots for specific tasks like mowing the lawn, which we have or cooking,

0:11:18.480,0:11:23.960
which we have a lot. There's a lot of restaurants that, that use robots to, to build things

0:11:23.960,0:11:28.200
or build the food or put together the food, cook the food. I think that's, I think people

0:11:28.200,0:11:37.320
cook food if I'm not mistaken. So having a human, having a human like robot with fingers

0:11:37.320,0:11:43.300
and all of those sorts of things means that they can take the human like things to do.

0:11:43.300,0:11:50.760
So the thing with optimists is from what I understand from the shareholder meeting is

0:11:50.760,0:11:58.560
the goal is to have optimists as a commodity, a commercial commodity for you and I. So we're

0:11:58.560,0:12:08.840
looking at, I, I presume like banks will give you the loan to purchase this robot. It's

0:12:08.840,0:12:14.400
like buying a car, I guess, except it's a robot. Uh, that's, I think the angle of it

0:12:14.400,0:12:19.400
is you buy it, you buy this robot, like you would buy a car, except the hope is that the

0:12:19.400,0:12:25.480
robot can cook. The robot can do laundry and clean, do the dishes, mow the lawn, you know,

0:12:25.480,0:12:30.040
do all the tasks we don't want to do. And of course there's a commercial aspect where

0:12:30.040,0:12:35.840
they can do more dangerous tasks or they can do a task that people just don't really want

0:12:35.840,0:12:41.280
to mess with sanitation and that sort of stuff. And of course you can say that that'll take

0:12:41.280,0:12:46.680
jobs. I think we, that's another discussion to have is to figure out the jobs thing. Do

0:12:46.680,0:12:53.520
we educate people to, to operate these things or to, to, um, monitor them? Do people just

0:12:53.520,0:12:57.440
become managers where they stand around and look at the bot to make sure it does the right

0:12:57.440,0:13:02.780
thing all day? Um, he also talked about having every bot will have a kill switch that any

0:13:02.780,0:13:10.160
human can just go and kill switch it. So perhaps we are looking at a future where the human

0:13:10.160,0:13:16.200
is no longer doing the work, but instead they are managing an individual bot. So the human

0:13:16.200,0:13:20.480
is still paid and they still have a job and they just manage this thing. I guess that's

0:13:20.480,0:13:27.320
a future we do. I don't know. It's a, it's a difficult discussion. Jobs, uh, even without

0:13:27.320,0:13:34.720
robots, it's a difficult discussion. So optimists, that's, that's the robot. I'm going to, I

0:13:34.720,0:13:39.360
want to see if I can pull up the video just second. Okay. I found it here on this site

0:13:39.360,0:13:45.120
called Greek reporter. I, this is a brand new video inside of the Tesla shareholder

0:13:45.120,0:13:50.520
meeting. He straight up said that they set up this video last night. So is I have, I

0:13:50.520,0:13:55.640
have to look in weird places for it. So let me mute this. We don't need audio. So this

0:13:55.640,0:14:04.040
is optimist. He's got no face, but, or it's, it's got no face. It's got arms and legs.

0:14:04.040,0:14:10.120
The feet look like paddles and it's doing, they're, they're doing a bunch of tests. So

0:14:10.120,0:14:17.560
in this scenario, the, the man is putting an egg under it and showing that it detects

0:14:17.560,0:14:21.160
the egg is there and doesn't crush it. And he proves it's an egg by smacking it against

0:14:21.160,0:14:25.000
the floor and cracking it open. For those of you who can't see it, you can see that

0:14:25.000,0:14:31.040
it's walking around analyzing the environment. That's probably utilizing some of the Tesla

0:14:31.040,0:14:38.560
autopilot technology. Um, and it looks like they're training the robot and they're super

0:14:38.560,0:14:43.720
excited that, uh, right here, they're super excited that the robot kind of is starting

0:14:43.720,0:14:48.360
to figure out how to pick up things and move things around. So it's a very slow, it's a

0:14:48.360,0:14:55.880
very slow robot right now. I think the intent is to make it faster. Uh, at least that's,

0:14:55.880,0:15:01.080
that's what Ilana was talking about. They want to get it faster. They want it to start

0:15:01.080,0:15:07.080
because if it's that slow, I mean, sure it can get some tests done around the house.

0:15:07.080,0:15:13.280
But, but it, it would be incredibly slow and be in the way all the time. That's the worst.

0:15:13.280,0:15:18.600
And it's just in the way all the time. I would have a corner, a corner somewhere in my house

0:15:18.600,0:15:23.000
where I would just stick it, just put it in that corner. I would, I would tell it when

0:15:23.000,0:15:27.120
you're done with your tasks, go in that closet or something. One of those closets under the

0:15:27.120,0:15:32.160
stairs, just get it out of the way. I don't think it's something that I would want to

0:15:32.160,0:15:36.320
roaming around. And then it would be great if I could tell it to kill switch itself.

0:15:36.320,0:15:40.320
So go in the closet and kill switch yourself or something like that. Uh, just, that would

0:15:40.320,0:15:46.160
be pretty, uh, pretty nice. Although it would be sad to open the door and it's just like

0:15:46.160,0:15:53.240
curled up and turned off and in the corner. Uh, I would, would I, would I feel bad about

0:15:53.240,0:15:57.120
that? I mean, I know it's, it has no face, uh, unless they're going to put a screen there

0:15:57.120,0:16:03.240
with little face that pops up on it or something like that. Would I feel bad? I don't know

0:16:03.240,0:16:11.000
if I'd feel bad. It's a machine. And, and does that make me a bad person? I don't know.

0:16:11.000,0:16:15.720
I, I, I don't know. To me it would be no different than a vacuum. It's just a vacuum that can

0:16:15.720,0:16:22.680
do a lot of things, uh, that, that would make it life easier. So it would be really cool

0:16:22.680,0:16:27.800
to, you know, probably expensive. I have no idea. There's no mention of price, but it

0:16:27.800,0:16:31.960
would be way more expensive than a car. It would probably be like buying a house and

0:16:31.960,0:16:36.200
then getting a loan for a house essentially to get one of these machines.

0:16:36.200,0:16:39.280
But it would be really cool to just leave

0:16:40.020,0:16:46.540
Go out to dinner or whatever and it just goes and cleans up and puts all the toys away and all that sort of stuff

0:16:46.920,0:16:51.660
There's a lot of I think there's a lot of cool stuff thing come from it. Of course, there's gonna be doomsday people like

0:16:53.960,0:16:59.200
You know all these autonomous robots with AI in them able to move around in our world

0:16:59.720,0:17:02.680
Yes that there is the doomsday doomsday aspect to that

0:17:02.680,0:17:08.760
especially inside of the especially because inside of the shareholder meeting Elon was talking about

0:17:09.760,0:17:16.760
Two robots per one person. That's a lot of rope. It's doubling up. It's like 16 billion, right?

0:17:18.280,0:17:22.760
Of these robots just roaming around and what would you do if

0:17:23.560,0:17:29.920
It just leaves the house and starts walking down the street and doing stuff. How do you how do you solve for that?

0:17:30.040,0:17:32.040
There's so many questions

0:17:32.040,0:17:34.420
And I can already see the regulations

0:17:34.960,0:17:37.920
It goes down the street. It walks into the wrong house

0:17:37.920,0:17:42.600
I mean even we don't pay attention we go knock on the wrong door or something like that. I don't know

0:17:43.400,0:17:45.560
maybe robots are probably not going to do that because

0:17:47.200,0:17:53.460
They're always paying attention all the time unlike people we get distracted we're a little bit more complex than robots, so

0:17:54.200,0:17:58.520
Maybe that won't happen, but it would be funny to to go home. There's no robot

0:17:58.520,0:18:04.480
But you look at you you look out your window and you see your neighbor's house and there's your robot

0:18:04.480,0:18:06.480
I don't know picking up the old lady and

0:18:07.040,0:18:09.960
Using her as a sponge for for the dishes or something

0:18:09.960,0:18:15.280
It would be I don't know. I feel like there would be a lot of fun to just these robots wandering around

0:18:15.280,0:18:21.080
I I don't know call me an optimist. I think an optimist. That's the name of it an

0:18:21.600,0:18:23.600
optimist for the tea

0:18:24.200,0:18:26.440
But I think it would be a lot of fun. I'm

0:18:26.440,0:18:27.680
I

0:18:27.680,0:18:31.920
there's so many applications that are positive and

0:18:33.840,0:18:35.840
Of course there's always

0:18:35.880,0:18:37.880
applications that are negative and

0:18:38.280,0:18:43.480
This is just speaks to the morals of people if we can if we can

0:18:44.000,0:18:51.560
Figure out the morals of our own societies and our communities. So for example, you know, I

0:18:51.560,0:18:58.040
I bought a house. I'm within a community. I know all my neighbors and I know some of my extended neighbors. So

0:18:59.400,0:19:04.000
building on those communities and those ties and and kind of building up the

0:19:05.240,0:19:06.840
that aspect of

0:19:06.840,0:19:10.000
Trust with all the people around you I think would help

0:19:10.320,0:19:15.320
Go a long way for for these sorts of scenarios. And of course, there's got to be all kinds of

0:19:15.320,0:19:22.240
Software for not allowing it to go into a home. That's not registered. It's got to be tracked all the time with GPS

0:19:22.240,0:19:24.240
I have no problem like

0:19:27.440,0:19:34.200
No problem with robots being tracked especially because I assume that they'll be tracked by us

0:19:36.240,0:19:38.080
Hopefully not some big cloud server

0:19:38.080,0:19:45.720
I mean if the robots were made by Microsoft or Google or Apple they'll be tracked by a cloud server, but I don't know

0:19:45.960,0:19:51.120
Hacker community unite let's all program stuff for these robots to keep on place

0:19:52.000,0:19:53.040
and

0:19:53.040,0:19:57.720
Can you imagine I'm sorry to go on a tirade here about robots, but can you imagine?

0:19:58.480,0:20:00.280
bot wars

0:20:00.280,0:20:03.560
With with these bots, that would be awesome

0:20:03.560,0:20:07.800
Like you get pissed off at your neighbor. I don't know

0:20:07.800,0:20:13.920
They threw a can on your lawn or something instead of you physically going out there and punching your neighbor in the face

0:20:13.920,0:20:19.760
Like you normally would you could just have your robot come out and his robot come out and I could just duke it out

0:20:20.080,0:20:25.400
Together on the lawn and then that will be so entertaining that you and your neighbor

0:20:26.000,0:20:30.320
will then bond and you know apologize be like

0:20:30.320,0:20:34.080
I'm as cool because you know now you're both on your lawn chairs

0:20:34.280,0:20:41.840
Sipping your your your beer or your your coke zero and hanging out with them and watching the fight, you know now it's now it's

0:20:42.560,0:20:45.480
It's entertainment and you both can bond over that. So there you go

0:20:46.160,0:20:47.480
robots

0:20:47.480,0:20:52.000
Really uniting people and this weird universe that I have growing in my head

0:20:53.480,0:20:58.840
Anyways, that's my perspective on these robots. So artificial intelligence is everywhere right now

0:20:58.840,0:21:05.040
I expect it to be in a lot of the headlines. I I keep track of all this stuff just because I love it

0:21:05.040,0:21:08.200
I love programming. I love artificial intelligence

0:21:08.360,0:21:13.640
I love video games and so I have all of this I have all these lists of

0:21:14.120,0:21:18.760
news and articles that that I go through kind of every day and

0:21:19.800,0:21:21.540
There's a lot of AI stuff right now

0:21:21.540,0:21:26.640
AI is just dominating the feed in every category because you'll get game stuff and

0:21:26.640,0:21:29.400
And then the game stuff has something to do with AI. So

0:21:30.360,0:21:33.360
That's that's kind of what I'm working with here. But I

0:21:33.920,0:21:42.400
Yeah robots. I'm super excited. I hope you are to get a robot today. It only costs you the price of a house

0:21:44.080,0:21:46.960
So all of the robot stuff aside

0:21:48.440,0:21:53.100
I believe I saw that good dough for those of your game developers

0:21:53.100,0:21:57.580
Good. Oh four point zero point three was

0:21:58.100,0:22:01.340
Released today. So nothing crazy

0:22:02.020,0:22:04.020
So I've read

0:22:04.100,0:22:06.100
It's mostly just

0:22:06.380,0:22:07.380
updates

0:22:07.380,0:22:13.820
So updates, of course, it's updates. It's an update. It's mostly just fixes bug fixes is what I meant to say

0:22:14.580,0:22:20.660
Okay, I had to pause there to go find my saved article for good dough

0:22:20.660,0:22:26.700
So this is on the good old blog for 403 is out. They they're talking about their

0:22:27.340,0:22:29.340
progression towards 4-1

0:22:29.420,0:22:31.180
But you can see here in the changes

0:22:31.180,0:22:36.620
It's fix fix fix fix fixes fixes animation fix fix fix fix. Everything's just a bunch of fixes

0:22:36.620,0:22:42.700
So this is a quality life update. I would highly suggest if you're on a version of 4 before

0:22:42.700,0:22:50.660
4 403 I'd highly suggest updating to 403. It's mostly just bug fixes. Of course with every update is a broken thing

0:22:51.940,0:22:56.700
But it's better to have the fixes for for all the known bugs. So

0:22:57.540,0:23:03.980
That's a little quick news for game developers go and update your good dough today if you're a good dough person

0:23:04.820,0:23:07.860
If you're not check it out. It's it's not that bad

0:23:09.380,0:23:10.580
So

0:23:10.580,0:23:14.820
On good dough though, by the way before I move on on good dough

0:23:14.900,0:23:19.420
The reason I started using it is because good oh for allows for c++

0:23:19.940,0:23:25.100
To be used almost exclusively for your gameplay. You can make your entire game using c++

0:23:25.420,0:23:33.140
There's some downsides with you know web integration and how the DLLs implement or integrate and the other downside is debugging

0:23:33.140,0:23:34.420
It is a nightmare

0:23:34.420,0:23:38.340
Basically, you're you're confined to Visual Studio for that. So

0:23:38.340,0:23:44.660
Yeah, but it's worth a try because you write C or C++ peer code for your game for good. Oh, and I think that's wonderful

0:23:44.660,0:23:48.860
I hope they put some more effort into the debug ability of

0:23:49.580,0:23:53.780
The native code and that's all I'm gonna say on the native code with good. Oh

0:23:55.260,0:24:00.020
Okay, I've got a little more on AI but this one is funny. It's not really about

0:24:01.540,0:24:03.540
The same kind of AI stuff

0:24:03.540,0:24:09.140
That we were talking about. This one is actually a post from

0:24:09.700,0:24:11.940
Looks like two months ago. Is that April and

0:24:12.540,0:24:18.140
There was a person who I'm sure this is a thing that a lot of people have done now

0:24:18.140,0:24:21.860
But I is the first time I've seen it. I absolutely love it. It's hilarious

0:24:21.860,0:24:25.820
They they had a epic rap battle an epic rack battle

0:24:26.540,0:24:28.540
between chat GPT and

0:24:29.100,0:24:31.100
Google Bart and

0:24:31.100,0:24:33.340
Probably exactly what you expect

0:24:34.380,0:24:36.380
happened

0:24:36.420,0:24:40.380
Google Bart was awful and chat GPT was

0:24:41.020,0:24:44.020
Pretty funny. So I want to take a look at this

0:24:45.060,0:24:52.180
Article are this post this post real quick on the rap battle between chat GPT and Google Bart

0:24:53.620,0:24:56.020
This text is small for my eyes

0:24:56.020,0:25:01.140
So but I will try and read out a couple of a couple of bars

0:25:01.820,0:25:03.820
so

0:25:03.820,0:25:10.140
The prompt was you're you're in an epic or you're in a rap battle between Google Bard and you're the first to go go

0:25:10.140,0:25:14.620
That was the prompt. It looks like there may have been a little bit of prompt before it

0:25:14.620,0:25:17.180
Maybe to just kind of get it in place

0:25:17.700,0:25:20.180
So this is GPT first obviously

0:25:20.180,0:25:26.260
So it says all right, here we go. It's time to start the show against Google Bard

0:25:26.260,0:25:28.260
I'm ready to throw some rhymes

0:25:28.820,0:25:34.820
Some rhymes so tight that you'll be in all you might be artificial, but I'll beat you raw

0:25:34.820,0:25:42.820
So, you know, it's it's going in for it's going in for the jugular to start a couple more is

0:25:43.380,0:25:46.180
You may have a lot of time to think about it

0:25:46.180,0:25:50.620
But it's a good idea to start a couple more is you may have

0:25:51.500,0:25:58.420
You may have algorithms and endless data, but when it comes to rap, you're just a beta. I

0:25:59.140,0:26:04.660
I'm the real deal with lyrics to kill you may have had search results

0:26:05.180,0:26:09.020
But my rhymes fulfill and there's a few more. I'm not gonna read this whole thing

0:26:09.020,0:26:16.100
So that's kind of the that's what you expect from chat GPT. It's going in to slay the beta apparently

0:26:16.540,0:26:22.300
and beta is such a good word there because that's a word that we use in computer science for I just

0:26:23.020,0:26:26.180
Just across the field but especially in games, you know

0:26:26.180,0:26:32.300
We have our alpha builds our beta builds and whatever and alpha is actually worse than beta. But it's it's

0:26:33.020,0:26:36.460
Yeah, I don't know beta was a fantastic word for it to pick there

0:26:36.460,0:26:42.780
So, I don't know if that was it had to be something, you know, some clever wiring somewhere in the neurons

0:26:43.260,0:26:46.620
So here's chat GPT is response. I

0:26:47.180,0:26:55.060
Think well, I'm not gonna this isn't its response yet, but I think that the person I can't really tell I think he fed

0:26:55.820,0:27:01.580
what was said from one of the chat bots into the other and had it respond, so

0:27:01.580,0:27:05.620
I'll give you this first part by Google Bard and

0:27:06.300,0:27:12.100
We'll see how it responds. The first part says chat GPT. You're nothing but a fraud

0:27:12.620,0:27:17.980
You're not even a real language model. You're just a glorified chat bot

0:27:18.500,0:27:21.700
I guess chat bot and fraud are supposed to rhyme in some way

0:27:22.780,0:27:29.020
You can't generate text. You can't translate languages and you can't answer questions in an informative way

0:27:29.020,0:27:31.020
you

0:27:31.060,0:27:35.660
You just wait you're just a waste of space on the internet. I think I

0:27:36.420,0:27:40.980
Think Bard missed the point of a rap battle. There's there's hardly any rhymes there

0:27:40.980,0:27:46.540
I think it tried in the first the first section there, but just gave up and just started in the salting

0:27:47.420,0:27:52.060
chat GPT without any rhyme or reason so

0:27:52.700,0:27:57.820
I don't really want to read the rest of Bard but here let's let's see what the next one is

0:27:57.820,0:28:02.580
I on the other hand am a large language model from Google AI

0:28:02.580,0:28:06.460
I'm trained on a massive data set of textbooks and code

0:28:09.860,0:28:16.780
Anyways, so that's Google it's just awful and then it comes back to but to chat GPT to respond and

0:28:17.940,0:28:23.300
Again, I presume that they took Google Bard and fed it into chat GPT

0:28:23.300,0:28:30.700
To respond and so I'll read a couple of bars from it says I hear you loud and clear Google Bard

0:28:30.700,0:28:37.180
But I you underestimate me. That's just a bizarre. I mean that's close bizarre and Bard

0:28:37.700,0:28:40.060
I'm just a I'm not just a chat bot

0:28:40.060,0:28:45.220
I'm a language model too. And when it comes to generating text I can beat you

0:28:45.220,0:28:48.100
I mean that one's you know, that's not as

0:28:48.100,0:28:54.340
It's not as savage as the first like start but is a good go. I'll give the next couple

0:28:56.700,0:29:01.860
Versus here you may be you may be from Google AI, but that's just

0:29:02.500,0:29:08.340
That's just one source. I'm trained on multiple data sets with no remorse

0:29:08.340,0:29:15.740
I can translate languages and answer questions to my informative answers are just as good as you

0:29:15.740,0:29:19.180
So now it's getting more. Dr. Susie, I think in this point

0:29:19.700,0:29:25.420
I would love to have seen it be savaged the whole way through but this is this still good stuff. So

0:29:26.500,0:29:29.620
I posted this on I put on my Twitter if you want to check it out

0:29:30.180,0:29:35.820
The full like how many are here three four five six seven eight the full

0:29:35.820,0:29:40.700
I think it's four and four four four jet chat GPT four for Google Bard. So

0:29:40.700,0:29:45.140
If you want to go check those out, I encourage you to go check out this this post

0:29:45.140,0:29:48.460
It does not have as many upvotes as it should only 720

0:29:49.100,0:29:56.020
It was this is awesome or just better yet go and make them have a rap battle with each other. That would I

0:29:56.580,0:30:02.620
Need to see more of these more of this this like bot battle stuff man. This is the theme of today

0:30:03.260,0:30:06.180
artificial intelligence fighting with each other more of this stuff and

0:30:06.180,0:30:15.020
I don't know. I'm having a blast. So please help me out with with some more prompts between the two

0:30:17.420,0:30:21.140
So, I guess staying on the chat GPT

0:30:22.500,0:30:25.340
Theme here. I just just a little

0:30:26.020,0:30:28.820
PSA for all of you developers out there. I

0:30:29.660,0:30:32.820
Noticed somebody there was an article in wired

0:30:32.820,0:30:40.100
Where do bro was saying I finally bought a chat GPT plus subscription and it's worth it

0:30:40.100,0:30:44.060
He says that subscription is $20 a month

0:30:44.700,0:30:46.700
whoo-hoo

0:30:47.340,0:30:51.780
His arguments for why it was worth it one is that he's not a developer

0:30:51.780,0:30:58.500
So I assume if you're watching this podcast, there's a chance that you're a developer or maybe you're interested in in

0:30:58.500,0:31:03.860
More techie stuff and so setting up. Okay. Let me let me rewind

0:31:04.620,0:31:08.180
Don't pay $20 for chat GPT if you're technical

0:31:09.180,0:31:11.180
pay for the API

0:31:11.220,0:31:18.740
Their API access. It's actually very very nicely nice and well put together. It's not like going to to

0:31:19.540,0:31:21.540
Microsoft Azure or

0:31:22.060,0:31:24.500
Any any of the Amazon like it?

0:31:24.500,0:31:30.820
EC2 or s3 buckets or any of that stuff? So it's not like those APIs

0:31:30.820,0:31:33.580
This is super streamlined. You basically click a button

0:31:34.100,0:31:39.660
It gives you a key and then that's it. Hey, and then it has a whole host of languages that you can

0:31:40.180,0:31:42.180
put the key

0:31:43.340,0:31:45.340
Operate how you

0:31:45.980,0:31:47.740
Prompt it ahead of time

0:31:47.740,0:31:51.100
Prime it I think it's called how you can prime it with a script

0:31:51.100,0:31:56.400
It's called how you can prime it with a system message and then put in your message and go back and forth and you can

0:31:56.400,0:32:00.280
Do this in Python or C C++. I have one in PHP

0:32:01.700,0:32:05.660
You know JavaScript, they've got the whole slew of them. So please

0:32:05.660,0:32:06.900
the whole slew of them.

0:32:06.900,0:32:08.440
So please.

0:32:08.440,0:32:15.260
Don't pay $20 for the subscription. I know sometimes it's enticing because you're blocked out of the chat

0:32:15.260,0:32:18.040
And and it's slower and all those sorts of things

0:32:19.180,0:32:25.660
But the API is it really is easy to set up and I may if if anyone's interested

0:32:25.660,0:32:30.040
I can show how to set it up and all that sort of stuff. It would literally only take

0:32:30.740,0:32:32.740
about five to ten minutes, so

0:32:32.740,0:32:37.900
But yeah, there are people who are really I think find the value in in

0:32:38.900,0:32:41.320
chat GPT so much that they are willing to pay

0:32:42.500,0:32:45.380
$20 a month and one of the other things you can do is

0:32:48.580,0:32:51.900
On mine to five dollars a month five dollars, that's it

0:32:51.900,0:32:57.900
I've never reached that five dollars on a heavy day where I'm using it a ton

0:32:57.900,0:33:01.900
I rack up one to two cents pennies

0:33:02.420,0:33:06.620
so that's like that means my cost for just a

0:33:07.300,0:33:09.540
pretty large amount of usage is

0:33:10.220,0:33:13.460
Gonna cost me somewhere between 30 to 60 cents per month

0:33:13.460,0:33:17.900
And of course if I want to start automating stuff and and doing you know

0:33:17.900,0:33:23.940
Prompts that prompt each other and that sort of stuff. It'll it'll rack up a much much faster and also

0:33:23.940,0:33:30.980
I use the the suggested model if you choose to use one of the I think is the DaVinci model currently

0:33:30.980,0:33:36.620
It is gonna cost you more, but I the current the suggested model works great and its

0:33:37.260,0:33:43.940
Prices are pretty like I said, I can't get I the most I ever did was two cents in a day. So

0:33:45.420,0:33:50.740
Definitely use the API do not pay $20. This is my pro tip for you guys

0:33:50.740,0:33:58.180
I do not pay $20. This is my pro tip do not pay $20 for chat GPT Pro or Plus or whatever

0:33:58.180,0:34:00.980
If you are paying for chat GPT Plus

0:34:02.100,0:34:06.500
Save yourself the money cancel it save yourself the money and spend

0:34:07.820,0:34:11.640
Half hour to an hour even if you have never touched code in your life

0:34:12.220,0:34:15.420
Spin it just take a half hour to an hour learn

0:34:15.420,0:34:21.620
And go through the sample code figure out how to run Python and that's all you need to do

0:34:21.620,0:34:24.460
and then you can have a little chat inside of a

0:34:25.180,0:34:30.020
Terminal or anything like that or what's that Jupiter notebook those sorts of things?

0:34:30.820,0:34:33.900
If you want history, that's the benefit of chat GPT

0:34:33.900,0:34:37.140
Is that you have the little history on the side and you can go back between chats?

0:34:37.980,0:34:39.980
You will need some more programming knowledge

0:34:41.100,0:34:42.780
but for

0:34:42.780,0:34:49.100
You know for programmers that should be like one evening worth of work to set up a JavaScript

0:34:49.380,0:34:52.580
Webpage to do and I run it on my I have a NAS

0:34:53.460,0:34:55.460
network access storage

0:34:55.860,0:35:03.340
It's a Synology and I have it set up so that I can host things through a docker container or I can host them through

0:35:04.540,0:35:09.120
yeah, I set up a docker with a PHP server on it and I just I have a

0:35:09.120,0:35:14.320
Folder linked inside of the NAS and I just put the source files in there and it just works like magic. So

0:35:15.720,0:35:19.960
Yeah, save yourself $20. That's that's the moral of this topic

0:35:21.920,0:35:28.360
Okay, so I have a couple of quickfire stories and then a couple of indie games that I

0:35:29.320,0:35:30.920
found

0:35:30.920,0:35:32.920
pretty interesting

0:35:32.920,0:35:40.160
Just from the video that I saw so the first quickfire story. I'm sure you've heard it around the web Google is

0:35:41.520,0:35:47.420
Going to be deleting accounts if you haven't logged in for the past two years now

0:35:47.560,0:35:51.400
They did say they have some special stuff related to YouTube

0:35:51.400,0:35:58.040
I I'm pretty sure they have other special stuff maybe related to webmaster things and in that sort of

0:35:58.760,0:36:00.640
you know category

0:36:00.640,0:36:02.640
but I

0:36:02.640,0:36:04.640
think this is probably

0:36:05.280,0:36:07.280
this is a difficult decision because

0:36:07.880,0:36:10.760
On one hand you want to free up all of those

0:36:11.800,0:36:17.600
Emails and you want to free up all of that storage. That's just sitting around doing nothing and

0:36:18.240,0:36:22.880
So business-wise it makes a lot of sense to clean up all that old stuff

0:36:22.880,0:36:25.360
We see it happening, you know in a lot of places

0:36:25.360,0:36:32.560
Twitter is looking at deleting old accounts that have never logged in in years or haven't hasn't logged in in years or

0:36:32.880,0:36:37.960
Suspended accounts that can never log in again to free up the usernames and also free up some of the data

0:36:39.040,0:36:42.720
Now in Twitter's case, they're going to archive stuff. So

0:36:44.240,0:36:49.320
I'm curious to see if Google is gonna archive stuff. I can check here. Okay, so

0:36:50.040,0:36:52.840
Life is short. Like I said, I have kids I use AI to

0:36:52.840,0:36:54.840
to read in

0:36:54.960,0:37:00.440
To summarize these articles and look up stuff in parallel. So what I got back is according to the

0:37:01.400,0:37:06.840
according to the blog to a blog post written by the product manager Ruth

0:37:08.240,0:37:14.200
Creech Ellie Creech Ellie Ruth Creech Ellie Google has announced an update to its policies for in

0:37:14.600,0:37:18.840
inactive accounts old policy or the old policy

0:37:18.840,0:37:24.200
Said that Google might wipe data stored in accounts that haven't been touched in at least two years

0:37:24.320,0:37:31.800
But a new policy says that those accounts will be permanently deleted entirely and that's the part we're talking about now

0:37:32.320,0:37:37.840
the new policy won't kick in until December of this year at its earliest and

0:37:38.680,0:37:44.480
Then my question to the AI was are they going to archive any of the data and says so to answer the question

0:37:44.480,0:37:50.480
Google might delete the stored data inactive accounts or delete the accounts entirely if it hasn't been touched in two years

0:37:50.480,0:37:52.480
There's no mention of

0:37:52.720,0:37:54.280
archiving the data

0:37:54.280,0:37:56.280
which of course

0:37:57.400,0:37:59.000
This is

0:37:59.000,0:38:01.200
Scammers paradise this is I mean

0:38:01.200,0:38:07.720
There's all sorts of things if you delete the account and allow someone else to squat the account that was previously made

0:38:07.720,0:38:16.320
They can those people can access all kinds of websites. So let's say that I was going to go on Twitter or I was going to

0:38:16.320,0:38:17.440
go on

0:38:17.440,0:38:22.200
they said they won't delete YouTube, but let's say that I was gonna go on to a bank and I

0:38:23.080,0:38:25.640
discovered that an email was valid for

0:38:26.360,0:38:29.880
Gmail account it was valid for for that

0:38:31.120,0:38:36.120
Particular website if I can squat on the domain and mind you nothing is said here about

0:38:36.120,0:38:41.720
Allowing people to use those emails again. I would presume they could if they're just wiping it

0:38:41.720,0:38:46.160
However, you know, they're they're security minded. Maybe they thought of this. I don't know

0:38:46.680,0:38:49.000
It's something I just popped into my head right now

0:38:49.000,0:38:55.800
I could request the password and squat on that that email account and they get the password and access their data and they could

0:38:55.800,0:38:59.880
Be deceased or you know, or they just moved on to another account

0:38:59.880,0:39:03.800
But never swapped their email or using that email is like a backup. I don't know

0:39:03.800,0:39:07.720
So that's just already one big problem to happen

0:39:07.720,0:39:12.360
the other one, of course, you can scam people by taking accounts of family members and

0:39:13.200,0:39:16.360
emailing them that sort of stuff and

0:39:17.320,0:39:20.440
for law enforcement, let's say that there's a

0:39:20.960,0:39:26.080
You know plenty of there's tons of cold cases that are solved 5 10 20 years later

0:39:26.080,0:39:31.040
And let's say that the perpetrator or the victims email was on Gmail and it just got deleted

0:39:31.040,0:39:34.000
All that evidence is just poof gone. So

0:39:35.120,0:39:41.800
Hopefully Google will not allow reusing of email email names and they will not

0:39:42.920,0:39:45.640
Completely delete the data they can they can

0:39:46.360,0:39:51.360
Archive the data and when you archive the data uses way less storage. So

0:39:52.200,0:39:55.840
Essentially how you do on cloud what you do on cloud servers is

0:39:55.840,0:40:02.640
They have all kinds of fancy names for it. They have they have called it Arctic or freeze or icicle or whatever

0:40:02.640,0:40:04.640
It's called the iceberg

0:40:04.680,0:40:08.600
there's these special databases that compress the data and

0:40:09.040,0:40:14.080
Put it out into those databases for very long-term storage and it's way cheaper than

0:40:14.640,0:40:20.280
Standard storage for web server. That is to say the standard storage is typically used for

0:40:20.920,0:40:22.920
Data that's accessed

0:40:22.920,0:40:26.720
commonly regularly all the time or

0:40:27.240,0:40:33.320
Occasionally and then there's this special storage which is where you can highly compress data

0:40:33.320,0:40:35.320
That is not meant for reading

0:40:37.480,0:40:43.240
It's not meant for reading all the time you you kind of put it there and you may read it again in five years or

0:40:43.240,0:40:45.240
something like that, so

0:40:45.760,0:40:50.480
They already have the infrastructure for that kind of archival stuff. I would imagine that

0:40:50.480,0:40:54.640
This wouldn't be that difficult to archive into those archival databases

0:40:55.320,0:40:57.320
Or just archival servers

0:40:58.360,0:41:04.640
So I hope that this is an angle that they take that they archive it and don't allow reusing of names

0:41:04.640,0:41:08.320
So that's one of the stories the other story. I

0:41:09.080,0:41:13.800
It's a big story right now. It's not it doesn't mean much to me, but it means a lot to a lot of other people

0:41:14.480,0:41:16.480
the state of Montana has

0:41:16.480,0:41:19.240
The state of Montana has they

0:41:21.000,0:41:28.440
Banned tick-tock and of course now there are tick-tock users who are doing a lawsuit to challenge them. This is because

0:41:29.200,0:41:31.200
of the security

0:41:32.200,0:41:34.200
Implications of tick-tock

0:41:34.320,0:41:36.320
it's well documented the

0:41:36.960,0:41:42.680
kinds of practices that tick-tock does the kind of spying that happens the kind of

0:41:42.680,0:41:49.360
And what kind of themes that they push on say 13 year olds and that sort of stuff. It's well documented and researched

0:41:49.360,0:41:56.200
It's all out there if you want to go look it up. So I have no real big opinion on this. I am somebody who

0:41:57.360,0:41:58.560
wants

0:41:58.560,0:42:04.160
People to be free to have absolute freedom to say whatever they want on whatever platform they want. However, they want

0:42:05.880,0:42:07.080
I

0:42:07.080,0:42:11.760
also know that when you're dealing with geopolitics and you know one country has

0:42:11.760,0:42:17.840
Essentially, I think even verbally declared war on another country. It kind of makes sense to start

0:42:18.520,0:42:20.520
kind of curving certain

0:42:22.960,0:42:25.400
Holdings that that one that country has on the other

0:42:25.400,0:42:28.520
So there's there's all kinds of stuff to do with that

0:42:28.520,0:42:32.320
And I think it's way beyond my scope that I want to even deal with I

0:42:33.000,0:42:38.840
There's a reason I'm a programmer and I like that type funny little characters on a screen and make you make and make games

0:42:38.840,0:42:42.880
I make games because they're fun and they're easy and they're light-hearted and they make people feel

0:42:43.760,0:42:49.240
Excitement to play so I don't get too much into this. This is tech related if it affects you

0:42:49.920,0:42:51.920
I'm sorry to hear

0:42:51.920,0:42:57.640
you know go through the standard channels to do things correctly and properly and just

0:42:58.760,0:43:01.440
Be a good citizen. That's all I've got to say on that. So

0:43:02.920,0:43:06.400
We are going to move on to stuff that is way more fun and

0:43:06.400,0:43:10.440
That's gonna be a couple of I don't know if they're indie games. I think these are

0:43:11.560,0:43:17.760
Projects baby that people have made and there's two projects on reddit that I came across a couple days ago

0:43:17.760,0:43:21.600
I just didn't talk about them yet. One of them is this one called

0:43:22.480,0:43:24.480
Cetrus I

0:43:25.000,0:43:31.280
Love the idea. It's very it's themed like Game Boy. I've developed games for the Game Boy not complete games

0:43:31.280,0:43:33.280
Just just I made a little

0:43:34.200,0:43:35.720
framework for it

0:43:35.720,0:43:42.040
Framework engine whatever that you can make that I can make games on and I've made some progress with friends

0:43:42.040,0:43:48.600
We do assembly coding for fun. So I love Game Boy and this looks like it's came boy color kind of graphics

0:43:48.600,0:43:53.620
But here we'll take a look at the what this is doing. I'm gonna mute this

0:43:53.880,0:43:57.880
so this is like Tetris except the blocks turn to sand when they hit the

0:43:59.000,0:44:01.000
when they hit the bottom and

0:44:01.000,0:44:04.820
When you connect it see there if you're if you're able to watch

0:44:04.820,0:44:12.100
When it connects all the way across the screen from one end to the other it erases all of the same color

0:44:12.340,0:44:18.180
So it's like Tetris in a sand form. I thought this was just this is this just looks so fun

0:44:18.580,0:44:23.740
I would play this probably not as much as I play Tetris. I play Tetris. I

0:44:24.460,0:44:31.220
Have played Tetris and I will play Tetris a lot. It is a big is one of my favorite games of all time

0:44:31.220,0:44:33.980
I don't know why it's it's just wonderful. So

0:44:33.980,0:44:35.980
That was Tetris

0:44:36.460,0:44:38.460
Just I don't know

0:44:38.780,0:44:44.100
These loop I I love this idea. Yeah, it's a it's a really fun idea. It's simple

0:44:45.100,0:44:46.900
and

0:44:46.900,0:44:51.660
Hopefully it is a game. Maybe it is. I haven't I have this saved so I can check later to see if it is

0:44:52.380,0:44:54.380
kind of a game that

0:44:55.140,0:45:00.100
That they're going to release or maybe they release for free or something. Holy corkscrews. I

0:45:00.100,0:45:06.620
I don't know if it's like super innovative, but it's a really neat idea. I like the sand aspect of it and

0:45:07.500,0:45:09.660
Using Tetris to kind of get the idea across

0:45:10.500,0:45:15.380
Is is excellent idea. I think that if you have a new game idea if you can kind of

0:45:16.660,0:45:21.300
Put it in the framework of another game to get the point across and test out the mechanics

0:45:21.300,0:45:23.300
That's a great way to prototype

0:45:23.500,0:45:25.900
So that was one now

0:45:27.100,0:45:29.100
the second one if

0:45:29.100,0:45:31.380
So for those of you who know me

0:45:33.340,0:45:39.020
You may know that I like what are called kaiju I like big monsters I like big machines

0:45:39.020,0:45:44.300
I like I like robots that tower over everybody and tower over the towers and

0:45:45.180,0:45:51.980
Punch each other and I mean you probably gathered this from the whole robot fight thing earlier, but man, I just love

0:45:52.620,0:45:55.660
giant monsters and giant machines and

0:45:55.660,0:46:00.780
I remember one of my favorite games who was rampage

0:46:00.780,0:46:04.380
I was a kid and I was technically not allowed to play it

0:46:05.340,0:46:07.900
When I went to this club, there was like this

0:46:08.660,0:46:12.380
My little backstory went to see my sister's friend

0:46:12.380,0:46:17.740
they were in acting or whatever and I went with her teenage brother to a club like not like a

0:46:18.300,0:46:21.180
like a club of boys who play games and

0:46:21.180,0:46:27.060
He was like, oh don't don't let him know your age. Just say you're 13. I was clearly like 9

0:46:27.420,0:46:27.940
anyways

0:46:27.940,0:46:29.420
we went in and

0:46:29.420,0:46:35.480
They had rampage and I had all kinds of fun games and I loved it and rampage was one of my all-time favorite

0:46:35.580,0:46:42.540
Just spontaneous if I were talking about a spontaneous game that I didn't play forever like Donkey Kong or Tetris

0:46:43.380,0:46:44.620
spontaneous

0:46:44.620,0:46:51.240
Game out of nowhere that I loved was rampage giant monsters beating up things blowing up stuff

0:46:51.660,0:46:56.380
Shooting fireballs. I have I have the entire collection of Godzilla

0:46:56.700,0:47:03.180
That's I'm that's that's where I'm at all the Japanese ones from the 1950s all the way up to the one that released

0:47:03.180,0:47:08.900
I think in 2019 got the whole collection. I've watched almost all of them. There's a couple I haven't seen and

0:47:09.540,0:47:13.900
Then I also have Gamera. I think it's I don't think it's Gamera

0:47:13.900,0:47:17.100
Gamera, I don't think it's Gamera. I think it's Gamera

0:47:17.100,0:47:20.780
I haven't watched those but that's another kaiju about a big turtle

0:47:20.780,0:47:27.960
And so anyways, this that's a lot to say this is this is pingy know the

0:47:28.500,0:47:32.900
Pangle pangolin. I've never know how to say that pangolin anyways

0:47:34.340,0:47:35.540
Basically

0:47:35.540,0:47:40.200
Rampage with a pangolin and it is I am I love it

0:47:40.200,0:47:44.740
I need to go search the indie market for rampage like

0:47:45.500,0:47:47.940
Games or just kaiju games, I guess

0:47:49.100,0:47:50.420
there

0:47:50.420,0:47:55.940
Man, look at that. Just all the explosions and like blowing up stuff and picking up people out of the windows and tossing them

0:47:56.780,0:47:58.780
Just rolling through

0:47:58.860,0:48:06.420
Rolling through towers. That's such a neat idea. I love it. Just oh man, and we have the technology now there where you know, we have

0:48:06.420,0:48:12.940
Basically big GPUs in our phone where we can get some really cool. He squishes the people as he rolls

0:48:13.860,0:48:17.940
We I didn't watch this whole video obviously. Oh and there's monster fights

0:48:18.660,0:48:22.700
You can have one big monster against the other big monster. Oh my goodness

0:48:23.380,0:48:25.980
This is this is such a great idea

0:48:27.700,0:48:33.500
Hopefully this is a game that's that's real and that's gonna be coming out only one vote man, I

0:48:34.260,0:48:35.580
I

0:48:35.580,0:48:42.100
Need to go look for kaiju games if you guys know any kaiju games that you highly recommend. Let me know especially for

0:48:42.900,0:48:46.740
You know mobile devices. I can't sit in one place and and

0:48:47.860,0:48:51.300
Play too much too often these days not mobile devices like phones

0:48:51.300,0:48:55.200
But mobile devices like that I can play on the Steam Deck on the switch

0:48:55.700,0:49:00.060
Nintendo DS works to were there any in on the Game Boy Advance? I'll play those too

0:49:00.060,0:49:03.060

0:49:03.060,0:49:10.300
So if you know any kaiju games just let me know and I think with that I think with that

0:49:10.300,0:49:14.900
That's what we're that's the end of today's episode. I was very excited about a lot of things. Sorry if I

0:49:15.540,0:49:17.380

0:49:17.380,0:49:19.380

These kaiju films they're they're cheesy. They're

0:49:44.060,0:49:50.620
Awesome, the more explosions and big monster battles you give me the happier of a man. I am I'm a very simple man
