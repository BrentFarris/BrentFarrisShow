All right, welcome back. Today I learned that Valve is getting sued for the Steam Deck.

0:00:06.160,0:00:13.880
Other than that, I wanted to talk about private chats, some AI stuff, some local AI stuff,

0:00:13.880,0:00:21.800
clean code and GitHub and that sort of stuff. So I guess the very first thing straight off,

0:00:21.800,0:00:29.000
I just learned about it a minute ago, was that Valve is now getting sued or, I don't

0:00:29.000,0:00:37.040
know, a lawsuit has been filed for the Steam Deck and you may be wondering what on earth

0:00:37.040,0:00:46.680
could it be over? And that's exactly what I was thinking. And it's for a patent. No,

0:00:46.680,0:00:52.880
Steam didn't, or Valve didn't just blatantly copy a patent or steal it or anything like

0:00:52.880,0:01:00.120
that. It's just that Valve is falling prey to a patent troll. If you don't know what

0:01:00.120,0:01:07.680
a patent troll is, it's basically a consortium of people who buy up software and hardware

0:01:07.680,0:01:12.440
patents and they produce nothing themselves. They just sit around on their thumbs doing

0:01:12.440,0:01:19.040
nothing other than they had some money to buy some ideas from people that were probably

0:01:19.040,0:01:22.440
smarter than they are. Or maybe they're not as smart as they are because they're the ones

0:01:22.440,0:01:27.560
who bought all the patents. And essentially what they do is they sue everybody and force

0:01:27.560,0:01:40.840
them to pay them royalties. And the patent that I didn't even know was a patent is haptics.

0:01:40.840,0:01:48.360
So the little vibrations that you feel on basically everything from phones to controllers,

0:01:48.360,0:01:54.520
those apparently are patented by some dudes somewhere who had enough money to buy the

0:01:54.520,0:02:00.560
patent and then do nothing other than sit there and reap rewards of everyone else's

0:02:00.560,0:02:08.200
success. I'm a little annoyed at it. I've always disliked patent trolls. I think the

0:02:08.200,0:02:15.600
way that I put it on Twitter was the idea guys that do nothing and sit in mom's basement

0:02:15.600,0:02:22.360
and perhaps all the other guys went off and they made something successful, but this dude

0:02:22.360,0:02:29.960
had equity so he's just going to reap the rewards for existing. It's very annoying.

0:02:29.960,0:02:38.160
It sucks. I think it stifles innovation. That's basically my take on that. In fact, here we

0:02:38.160,0:02:48.240
can take a look at it. Here I have the link. This is from The Verge. You can see, well,

0:02:48.240,0:02:54.360
it's night for you, morning, or it's night for me, morning for you. This just happened

0:02:54.360,0:03:02.760
a minute ago. The company is called Immersion Corporation. And that right there, that name

0:03:02.760,0:03:09.120
kind of gives away the game. Immersion Corporation sounds like we bought up all the patents for

0:03:09.120,0:03:14.240
haptics that we could find on the internet and are going to sue everybody into the ground

0:03:14.240,0:03:19.880
and otherwise force them to pay us royalties and also give us a big chunk of change right

0:03:19.880,0:03:28.040
at the beginning underneath the table. Otherwise, we're going to sue you. It's really annoying.

0:03:28.040,0:03:34.280
Immersion Corporation, I even looked up who the heck is Immersion Corporation and it's

0:03:34.280,0:03:42.440
just a bunch of flashy videos of phones and stuff. They produce nothing as far as I can

0:03:42.440,0:03:53.360
tell on here. Just some company that I would dare say stole patents with money. Stole it

0:03:53.360,0:04:00.480
with money. Anyways, that's really annoying. It happens to the best of us. Valve is probably

0:04:00.480,0:04:06.640
just going to pay them the money under the table or out of the court to skip the lawsuit

0:04:06.640,0:04:18.960
and just pay them royalties. I'm a little miffed about that. I don't know if other people

0:04:18.960,0:04:22.920
have the same feelings about it. I'm sure a lot of people are ambivalent to it. It just

0:04:22.920,0:04:35.040
annoys me, the guys who do nothing and prey on others. It's a little... Anyways, well

0:04:35.040,0:04:40.360
that's that. One of the things I wanted to go over today other than that, since that

0:04:40.360,0:04:50.240
popped out of nowhere, was private messages. Twitter recently released their secure messages.

0:04:50.240,0:04:58.480
I think that they were in talks with the guys from Signal and they produced their untrustable

0:04:58.480,0:05:08.560
or the don't trust it yet messaging system. That's just something that they mentioned.

0:05:08.560,0:05:16.880
Don't trust it yet, give it a try though. Now, I'm not a Twitter hater or I don't know

0:05:16.880,0:05:27.120
whatever bandwagon people have about all that. What I like is that there are private messages

0:05:27.120,0:05:33.200
at all, secure messages at all. A company like this does not have to add secure messaging

0:05:33.200,0:05:42.200
to their app. They could just go on being completely insecure. That's not great for

0:05:42.200,0:05:48.520
the people. It doesn't actually... Look, nobody is saying, I'm going to make a Twitter account

0:05:48.520,0:05:55.520
now because the messages are secure. I'm pretty sure most people don't even use Twitter direct

0:05:55.520,0:05:59.880
messages. I've never even used it. I'd like to use it now that it's secure. I'd like to

0:05:59.880,0:06:07.440
see what it looks like. Is there a little padlock or something? I'm curious. Not something

0:06:07.440,0:06:16.320
I'm going to jump ship from. I use Signal for all of my private messages with my family,

0:06:16.320,0:06:22.160
both my immediate family, like my wife and I almost exclusively talk on Signal. I have

0:06:22.160,0:06:27.560
a family group chat on there where I talk with all of my family. Sure, it does use up

0:06:27.560,0:06:32.680
a lot of your storage because it's locally stored. That's the whole point is that it's

0:06:32.680,0:06:39.160
not stored on somebody's server somewhere. I'm probably not going to be jumping ship

0:06:39.160,0:06:47.720
off of Signal anytime soon, maybe even ever. It all depends on where they take it. Companies

0:06:47.720,0:06:54.080
like this can promise the world and then swap out from underneath you to doing something

0:06:54.080,0:07:01.800
else. I think, though I like Telegram, I don't actively use it because it's hosted on somebody's

0:07:01.800,0:07:09.560
server somewhere and they kind of just promise security and safety and that sort of stuff.

0:07:09.560,0:07:14.440
You can trust it. Lots of people do. They could be telling the truth. I do like the

0:07:14.440,0:07:20.440
idea of it all being locally on my device, even if it is a little bit of an annoyance,

0:07:20.440,0:07:24.440
taking up the space and then having to make backups and then not being able to transfer

0:07:24.440,0:07:30.040
it to another device like my desktop. There are annoyances for it not being a server.

0:07:30.040,0:07:35.960
I would host my own or make my own little messaging app for my family. I've done Diffie

0:07:35.960,0:07:40.440
Hellman encryption, the whole process of updating the key on every message and all that sort

0:07:40.440,0:07:46.800
of stuff for fun. Making a whole app that my whole family is willing to jump on and

0:07:46.800,0:07:51.720
even friends and new friends are willing to jump on, it's not going to happen. It's a

0:07:51.720,0:07:57.560
lot easier for me to just use Signal. Moral of the story here is that I love that Twitter

0:07:57.560,0:08:07.600
is moving towards these secure DMs. Everything should be secure DMs. It's just out of respect

0:08:07.600,0:08:13.240
for the people who use your platform. All in all, they are trying to advertise to you

0:08:13.240,0:08:16.560
and you never know what's going on in the background. I think these are also on the

0:08:16.560,0:08:25.120
server kind of obviously. Same difference between the Twitter DMs and what's the one

0:08:25.120,0:08:36.320
Facebook owns, that one, and Telegram and all of those. So stick with Signal because

0:08:36.320,0:08:41.680
it's local. Signal does store it on a server until it gets delivered and confirm that it's

0:08:41.680,0:08:49.920
delivered. So there is that little middleman aspect there. It's kind of like a cousin of

0:08:49.920,0:08:55.280
mine. He said he loves Apple because of their secure messages. And then I asked him, I was

0:08:55.280,0:09:02.880
like, well, you know, they do have secure messages, but if you buy a new phone, you

0:09:02.880,0:09:07.280
get all of your old messages out of nowhere. That means that all the messages were stored

0:09:07.280,0:09:13.480
on some server and they can be decrypted on a different device. Just the different device

0:09:13.480,0:09:17.480
that exists, that just so happens to exist with your phone number. I don't know if it's

0:09:17.480,0:09:21.720
locked to your phone number or anything. So you can get all of your old messages and they

0:09:21.720,0:09:26.640
all get decrypted. So that right there just means that it exists somewhere and it can

0:09:26.640,0:09:34.240
be decrypted. So security is in the promise, I suppose, on that. But yeah, that was my

0:09:34.240,0:09:40.960
thoughts on Twitter secure DMs. If anyone exists out there that wants to try it out,

0:09:40.960,0:09:51.800
send me a message on Twitter. And yeah, thank you. So that's basically it for the secure

0:09:51.800,0:09:59.880
messaging stuff. I don't want to go on too much of a rant for that. Now, I did want to

0:09:59.880,0:10:07.240
talk about some AI stuff. As you know, I deal with AI stuff for fun. I like making random

0:10:07.240,0:10:14.280
prompts, that sort of stuff. Nothing serious. So I am not up to date on all the crazy newness

0:10:14.280,0:10:19.280
and all the things people are doing now and the tricks and that sort of stuff. So I just

0:10:19.280,0:10:27.280
learned about GPT4ALL today, which was pretty neat. If you haven't heard of it, it's basically

0:10:27.280,0:10:35.280
a local instance of these different models that you can run locally on your computer

0:10:35.280,0:10:44.400
without internet. And depending on your computer's processing power, it'll be slower or faster.

0:10:44.400,0:10:51.760
And you don't need a GPU to run it. I think that's because most of the training happens

0:10:51.760,0:10:58.280
through GPUs. But this is not training it. I think there is a way to train your own stuff,

0:10:58.280,0:11:02.760
which would be pretty cool. You'd take all the documents you've ever written or maybe

0:11:02.760,0:11:07.560
all the transcripts of all your videos or something like that and train the model on

0:11:07.560,0:11:14.040
it to be kind of like a mini-you, which would be kind of neat to see. But I like it just

0:11:14.040,0:11:21.600
for its local instance. So I wanted to point that out. I wanted to show which model I'm

0:11:21.600,0:11:29.720
using because the website itself says that this is the good model. So let's see if I

0:11:29.720,0:11:42.720
can zoom in. Oh, I can't zoom in. It's GPT4ALL JV1.3 Groovy. And if you go to GPT4ALL, here

0:11:42.720,0:11:51.800
let's just grab this and stick it up here, on their website they just boast about its

0:11:51.800,0:11:57.520
features. If you can't find the model you want, they do have this little drop-down that

0:11:57.520,0:12:02.000
tells you about the different models. So the one that's already selected is the one that

0:12:02.000,0:12:06.560
I downloaded. For me it was the second from the top, but I'm sure those shift around.

0:12:06.560,0:12:17.960
And it's the current best commercially licensable model based on GPT-J. And commercially licensable,

0:12:17.960,0:12:25.420
the reason that there is a distinction on these is that you can actually run a server

0:12:25.420,0:12:31.960
with this local instance. And you can run Python scripts to query against it and act

0:12:31.960,0:12:39.200
as like a client. And you can serve up servers and like make money using it and all that

0:12:39.200,0:12:44.720
sort of stuff. However, these models are licensed. Somebody did all the effort in training them.

0:12:44.720,0:12:50.160
So this particular one you can pay somebody, I guess, to use it if you want to use it commercially.

0:12:50.160,0:12:59.380
There are other ones like this Snoozy one, current best non-commercial commercially licensable

0:12:59.380,0:13:06.600
model. And the reason for that is that this is based on Llama13b, which is I think the

0:13:06.600,0:13:15.400
Facebook leaked stuff. So that's why you can't be like, yo, Facebook, I'm going to use that

0:13:15.400,0:13:20.360
thing that got leaked from your company. Can I give you a couple bucks? So obviously you

0:13:20.360,0:13:24.400
can't do that. But yeah, go give this a try. I was playing around with it on my laptop,

0:13:24.400,0:13:32.560
which is a Linux laptop with an Intel 11th Gen Tiger Lake, I think. It's not, yeah, Tiger

0:13:32.560,0:13:38.040
Lake processor. And it was fast enough. It was pretty decent. It wasn't like incredibly

0:13:38.040,0:13:42.120
slow. You'll try some of these offline ones and they're super slow. It was decently fast.

0:13:42.120,0:13:47.920
I haven't tried it on this computer yet, this laptop, much more beefy 12th Gen Intel core

0:13:47.920,0:13:58.000
processor. So I would be surprised if this one wasn't even faster. So yeah, go give this

0:13:58.000,0:14:04.920
a shot and try out that model. It's the second from the top for me, like I said, just review

0:14:04.920,0:14:14.680
it on the website and pick the model that you find most interesting. Another thing that

0:14:14.680,0:14:22.440
I learned about today, like I said, I'm just passively an AI person, prompter, whatever.

0:14:22.440,0:14:26.840
I don't make images or anything. I just like to prompt it and see what kind of stuff it

0:14:26.840,0:14:33.800
comes up with and cross-reference it or cross-check it. I don't know, check its work and that

0:14:33.800,0:14:39.200
sort of stuff. I do like to generate very small scripts that I really am too lazy to

0:14:39.200,0:14:48.320
write. So an example of a script that I wrote that I modified, I asked the AI to write it

0:14:48.320,0:14:54.200
for me, was a Lua script that took in a text file and this text file had time marks and

0:14:54.200,0:15:00.640
then text of what was being said at those time marks. And it converted it into an SRT

0:15:00.640,0:15:07.960
file, which is just a closed captioning kind of timing file that prints out the text that's

0:15:07.960,0:15:14.520
being said at that timestamp. So I just told it to write me that script and it busted one

0:15:14.520,0:15:19.800
out, had a couple of mistakes in it. It didn't check for blank lines and that sort of stuff

0:15:19.800,0:15:25.760
that I just quickly knocked it out and fixed it. And also added a little extra feature

0:15:25.760,0:15:30.360
so it would spit out an extra text file, which was just the raw text of what was said without

0:15:30.360,0:15:38.360
timestamps. So I do play around with these for all sorts of things, stories and code

0:15:38.360,0:15:45.760
and all that. But something I learned about today was super prompts, which is an awesome

0:15:45.760,0:15:52.480
name. I do love when names are nice, like, I don't know, fun, fun like this. Some names

0:15:52.480,0:15:58.880
can be really boring, like they're just named after people. Like some of these models like

0:15:58.880,0:16:03.640
Ada or DaVinci or whatever. Cool, you named it after a person. But super prompt, that's

0:16:03.640,0:16:12.000
awesome. I mean, super is used for a ton of things. Basically, you can probably be sued

0:16:12.000,0:16:19.280
by Nintendo by putting super in front of stuff. They've used it so much. But I don't know,

0:16:19.280,0:16:25.440
I like the title of it. So what I learned about the super prompt today is basically

0:16:25.440,0:16:31.880
you either set up a really big prompt, it's this huge prompt that uses almost all of your

0:16:31.880,0:16:36.880
tokens. And if you don't know what a token is, it's essentially you get 4096 tokens or

0:16:36.880,0:16:45.240
so depending on the service you use and what you pay for and all that. And each, about

0:16:45.240,0:16:51.120
a third of each word is a token. So just say like each word is a token. And it really depends.

0:16:51.120,0:16:54.840
It could be the characters if you're using UTF-8 or whatever, and you're using foreign

0:16:54.840,0:17:00.400
characters it may be per character that's presented. But generally in English I think

0:17:00.400,0:17:08.360
what they stated is it's on average about 75% of a word. And you can have up to 4096

0:17:08.360,0:17:15.160
of these tokens. And then when you hit that limit it won't respond or it just doesn't

0:17:15.160,0:17:21.680
know what to do. Often it'll say too much text or whatever. The webpage or whatever.

0:17:21.680,0:17:27.800
Even the local ones do this. They'll say, I filed too long or something like that. But

0:17:27.800,0:17:36.400
you can either pre-prompt it with one gigantic prompt and have it try to say things it shouldn't

0:17:36.400,0:17:41.160
say. Some people try to make it say bad words or whatever. But others try to make it sound

0:17:41.160,0:17:50.360
even more human or like you're talking to some specific character in history and making

0:17:50.360,0:18:00.440
it kind of reply as if it was that person. So the super prompt isn't always just the

0:18:00.440,0:18:07.160
one big prompt in the beginning. It's also you're able to do it by feeding it multiple

0:18:07.160,0:18:14.200
prompts over and over and kind of building out this super context I'll call it. I don't

0:18:14.200,0:18:22.320
think it's called super context but I'm going to call it super context. And what people do is they call it hypnosis.

0:18:22.320,0:18:30.680
They hypnotize the AI so to speak by repeating things they've previously said in varied ways

0:18:30.680,0:18:37.200
in order to kind of shepherd it into a certain direction. And that's just so that they can

0:18:37.200,0:18:45.040
hit the neurons that aren't often hit on the fringes of the, I don't know what to call

0:18:45.040,0:18:52.400
it, AI matrix mind. And then you can get some pretty cool responses. You can see kind of

0:18:52.400,0:19:01.240
the depth of its understanding of things. So those are kind of fun. That's what I learned

0:19:01.240,0:19:07.920
about today, super prompting. So go try to super prompt. Maybe you've done it without

0:19:07.920,0:19:18.720
even noticing that you've done it. Here I've just for completeness I asked Bing what a

0:19:18.720,0:19:25.400
super prompt was. And this was his response. You can pause to see this. I guess if you're

0:19:25.400,0:19:34.000
doing an audio only podcast. It says the super prompt is a term used in the context of chat

0:19:34.000,0:19:39.640
GPT. I don't know if it's specific to chat GPT. I just know it's used commonly with chat

0:19:39.640,0:19:44.760
GPT and other similar language models. It refers to a prompt that is designed to generate

0:19:44.760,0:19:48.920
a more advanced and complex response from the model. Super prompts are used to train

0:19:48.920,0:19:54.520
the model and generate more sophisticated responses that are closer to human-like conversation.

0:19:54.520,0:20:00.280
They're usually more detailed and specific rather than prompts that can include multiple

0:20:00.280,0:20:09.160
parts or sub parts. And these prompts can get long, by the way. So I think somebody

0:20:09.160,0:20:15.520
recorded like, I don't know if it was 16 minutes or 16 hours for chat GPT to respond with one

0:20:15.520,0:20:25.200
of these super prompts. And it was pretty neat. So go try super prompts today.

0:20:25.200,0:20:31.280
So we're going to jump from AI. We're going to talk more about some programming stuff.

0:20:31.280,0:20:36.040
As you know, I'm a programmer. I love code. I code all the time. I code as a day job.

0:20:36.040,0:20:40.000
I love code so much that I make this podcast and I include code stuff because I just love

0:20:40.000,0:20:44.500
code. So.

0:20:44.500,0:20:51.460
You may have noticed a huge trend in the last few years of people moving to clean code

0:20:51.460,0:20:53.460
I want to use quote clean code

0:20:54.100,0:20:56.220
or people moving towards

0:20:57.400,0:20:59.240
You know

0:20:59.240,0:21:00.420
craftsmanship

0:21:00.420,0:21:01.780
clean

0:21:01.780,0:21:03.900
architecture all the stuff all these buzzwords and

0:21:04.620,0:21:10.340
Clean code is basically like testable code test driven development for some people

0:21:10.340,0:21:12.340
Tiny functions

0:21:13.700,0:21:18.500
Making every making it so that your code doesn't need comments to explain itself anybody can read it

0:21:19.060,0:21:26.020
And I like to throw design patterns in there because it's not often said with clean code for some reason as far as I've seen

0:21:26.500,0:21:32.740
But there's some really good design patterns that help you create clean code. My favorite design pattern is

0:21:33.540,0:21:35.540
the visitor pattern and

0:21:35.540,0:21:41.780
Visitor pattern and that's basically where you can create a system that executes

0:21:42.300,0:21:44.220
some unknown

0:21:44.220,0:21:45.540
maybe

0:21:45.540,0:21:47.780
structured concept it's hard to explain and

0:21:48.700,0:21:54.100
You pass it a class or you pass it a function and that's the mechanic that it runs

0:21:54.680,0:21:58.620
The context that it runs within so in that way you can have this

0:21:58.620,0:22:06.580
Core system that does a specific thing and you can alter it by passing in a class with certain functions or functions

0:22:07.020,0:22:11.420
themselves to change the behavior while keeping that one particular

0:22:12.300,0:22:20.420
Piece of code. So I think an easy example would be like rather than using inheritance to say there's an animal and from the animal

0:22:20.540,0:22:23.140
there is or there's a being which

0:22:23.140,0:22:29.100
Animal derives from and then you have a dog and a cat and they both have speak and they do a different response

0:22:29.620,0:22:31.620
instead of having a hierarchy

0:22:31.700,0:22:33.700
you can have a flat class that is

0:22:34.420,0:22:40.380
Animal processor and then you pass in a dog which has a speak function you pass in a cat which has a speak function

0:22:40.380,0:22:43.780
And it does speak that way so you don't have to do inheritance in that way

0:22:44.980,0:22:48.940
Cats and dogs in this scenario don't have any relationship at all

0:22:48.940,0:22:54.820
They don't have to you can use an interface or you can pass them as a function the cat function that does

0:22:55.300,0:23:02.940
The cat speak function or whatever and so the class itself that's managing it just knows that it gets things that speak and

0:23:03.700,0:23:06.740
It runs the speak code on it. So

0:23:07.500,0:23:10.120
That's the visitor pattern. There's tons of patterns

0:23:10.700,0:23:16.980
Just look up the gang the gang of four book if you have the book you can just go to the very back

0:23:16.980,0:23:21.020
The very back of the book and it has a list of all the patterns, which is nice

0:23:23.540,0:23:25.540
But yes, I will say

0:23:26.940,0:23:29.340
All that being said do not

0:23:30.900,0:23:32.900
Do not

0:23:34.140,0:23:37.460
Vehemently abide by clean code. I'll tell you this now I

0:23:37.460,0:23:46.540
Write test functions to test AI generated code, but I don't often write test functions for my own code in my own projects

0:23:46.540,0:23:47.540
I

0:23:47.540,0:23:50.780
Make small functions that do very specific things

0:23:51.460,0:23:56.140
which it would be nonsensical for me to test because

0:23:57.020,0:24:00.460
Especially when I'm working alone when I'm working with a team, it's a different story

0:24:00.460,0:24:04.660
But when I'm working alone, I don't need to over complicate it. I know when I write a function

0:24:04.660,0:24:11.500
I don't change it if I change it. I'm very specific on how I refactor it whether it gets all deleted and

0:24:12.340,0:24:15.620
Replaced with something else or something in that realm. So

0:24:16.660,0:24:23.660
All you clean coders out there. Congratulations for knowing what clean code is and clean architecture and design patterns and

0:24:24.300,0:24:27.060
Test driven development and all that sort of stuff

0:24:27.940,0:24:29.500
but

0:24:29.500,0:24:34.740
Life is life is simple. Take it take it easy. Don't be zealot about it and

0:24:36.300,0:24:39.100
One of the things that you'll find is

0:24:39.700,0:24:44.940
If you adhere too close to clean code and everything's interfaces and everything's abstract and everything's going everywhere

0:24:45.860,0:24:47.300
especially for

0:24:47.300,0:24:49.300
your own personal projects or

0:24:49.660,0:24:54.980
Projects you put up on github as libraries. You'll find that you wind up with

0:24:54.980,0:25:01.460
Unreadable code anyways, even though your whole goal was to make readable code you get way too many

0:25:02.020,0:25:04.780
Intertwined different things or disconnected things even worse

0:25:05.900,0:25:08.700
One of the things I just an aside

0:25:09.300,0:25:12.420
When I program in unity, I like to

0:25:12.980,0:25:17.700
Leverage unity so all of its signals all of its how it connects different objects

0:25:17.700,0:25:23.740
I like to leverage it because when another person who's using unity comes and they they want to work with me

0:25:23.740,0:25:25.740
or they they

0:25:25.780,0:25:30.420
Just see the code or see the project. They understand what's going on

0:25:30.420,0:25:32.700
They can find where things are and what things are doing

0:25:33.100,0:25:34.860
they don't have to go through and

0:25:34.860,0:25:40.980
Find the class and then go to its manager and then go to the then go to the facade which manages the managers

0:25:41.500,0:25:45.660
List which comes from a factory which comes from an abstract factory

0:25:45.660,0:25:51.660
They don't need to go through all that to figure out that the character can jump they can see just straight in the code

0:25:51.660,0:25:53.660
Exactly what it's doing

0:25:54.060,0:25:58.580
And I get trying to abstract a way to make everything interchangeable and all that

0:25:59.260,0:26:01.260
But I will argue

0:26:01.460,0:26:05.420
That as a huge proponent of clean code by the way

0:26:06.060,0:26:09.620
In a lot of scenarios when especially in working with teams

0:26:11.940,0:26:15.260
It is a major downside and I will argue that

0:26:15.700,0:26:18.860
It'll bloat your code and make it unreadable if you adhere to it too far

0:26:18.860,0:26:23.140
And it'll slow down your code because you've you've abstracted everything

0:26:24.620,0:26:27.100
Just off to oblivion so

0:26:28.020,0:26:32.620
What I like to do in my personal projects is I like to stick to flat

0:26:33.500,0:26:35.500
non-hierarchical

0:26:35.540,0:26:38.980
refactorable code the most important thing in my mind is

0:26:39.500,0:26:43.900
That I write code that is easy to refactor whether it's deleting whole functions and replacing them with another

0:26:44.580,0:26:47.500
Or I write code that is easy to refactor

0:26:47.500,0:26:49.500
whether it's deleting whole functions and replacing them with another or

0:26:49.940,0:26:51.220
just

0:26:51.220,0:26:53.220
changing out being able to

0:26:53.620,0:26:58.700
Delete maybe an entire set of files or change out the data structure

0:26:59.620,0:27:03.660
Easily, that's what I aim for is refactorable code because I refactor my code

0:27:04.300,0:27:11.260
Non-stop all the time over and over my game engine that I was I've written NC has been rewritten multiple times

0:27:11.260,0:27:14.460
I've converted it to C++ and converted back to C twice and

0:27:15.020,0:27:17.020
I've also

0:27:17.020,0:27:21.860
Refactored the entire math library and everything else. And so it's been it's like

0:27:23.020,0:27:25.020
What's that joke Theseus's ship?

0:27:25.020,0:27:27.300
I know that off the top of my head because

0:27:27.620,0:27:33.220
My wife has been making fun of this person who fixes her husband's shoes and not making fun of her

0:27:33.220,0:27:37.700
But making fun of the people comment on it because every comment is oh, it reminds me of Theseus ship

0:27:37.780,0:27:41.100
But that's kind of what my code is. Like everything's been replaced

0:27:41.100,0:27:46.700
It's it's not none of the code is the same from the original maybe except for some of my standard string

0:27:46.700,0:27:48.700
String functions and stuff like that

0:27:49.460,0:27:55.780
So that's my thoughts on the clean code try to do clean code, but don't don't stick to it too strictly

0:27:57.740,0:28:01.880
Now I I don't want to speak just to advanced programmers

0:28:02.820,0:28:06.980
to to more inexperienced programmers people who are just

0:28:07.540,0:28:13.820
Learning or learning the ropes or getting into things or you're an advanced programmer. You've done assembly coding, but you haven't done any web

0:28:13.820,0:28:19.540
One of the things that I've seen in repositories recently, which is why I want to talk about it is

0:28:19.980,0:28:27.780
you'll find API keys and other sensitive keys and that sort of stuff inside of public github repositories and

0:28:29.540,0:28:33.780
You know people can take those keys and wind up racking up a bill for you

0:28:33.780,0:28:36.460
in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if there's people who

0:28:37.100,0:28:39.540
crawl through the different projects looking for

0:28:39.540,0:28:44.740
Keywords for specific API's and see if they can't get a free key for a little bit and

0:28:47.260,0:28:51.820
And I've seen people ask about it, what do you do with you know these keys so

0:28:52.540,0:28:56.100
Especially in web or any kind of development. It doesn't have to be web. You could be deploying

0:28:56.620,0:29:02.100
Game server or anything like that. You don't put your keys anywhere in your code base at all

0:29:02.100,0:29:09.820
I if you need to regenerate keys because you forgot it or you've deleted something that you're keeping it

0:29:09.820,0:29:13.140
It is a secure place. You were keeping it in no big deal regenerate it

0:29:15.260,0:29:16.460
But

0:29:16.460,0:29:18.660
What you want to do is when you deploy?

0:29:19.300,0:29:20.780
your

0:29:20.780,0:29:25.980
Code your application your game server is that you want to push your key?

0:29:26.620,0:29:30.260
Through through and add it as the environment variables

0:29:30.260,0:29:32.620
Or add it as a file. That's inaccessible

0:29:34.140,0:29:39.220
That's kind of in a weird directory that is hard for anyone to accept access without

0:29:40.340,0:29:42.340
You know root privileges or something like that

0:29:43.460,0:29:45.940
Just you want to push your keys?

0:29:46.860,0:29:50.500
Into your server, so don't put it in your code base. Don't put in any code base

0:29:50.500,0:29:54.540
Don't even put it in a private repository. Just keep them locally and

0:29:55.180,0:29:57.180
Push them if you're using docker

0:29:57.180,0:29:59.820
Often you'll put these in environment variables

0:30:00.540,0:30:02.860
And just push them off to the server, so

0:30:03.980,0:30:09.020
That's just a little tip on that because I've seen some issues with that

0:30:10.380,0:30:12.380
so

0:30:12.500,0:30:16.700
This one is pretty cool. I found a random project where

0:30:17.580,0:30:20.020
somebody was doing a map of

0:30:21.340,0:30:23.340
github and

0:30:23.380,0:30:25.380
This was a pretty neat project. I

0:30:25.380,0:30:27.380
Like these kinds of things I

0:30:28.020,0:30:31.780
Like especially and like in these where it connects things

0:30:31.780,0:30:35.900
I don't know why they're connected probably because they're forks of each other or something like that

0:30:36.780,0:30:42.820
but I have this page here called map of github and

0:30:44.220,0:30:48.260
This is who it's made by and that and Vaca

0:30:49.340,0:30:51.340
here I mean

0:30:51.380,0:30:53.380
and go to his

0:30:53.380,0:30:56.260
And go to his in Seattle

0:30:57.620,0:30:59.620
There's a lot of web stuff anyways

0:31:00.420,0:31:01.540
here

0:31:01.540,0:31:04.900
Here's land of unity so we can zoom in on the land of unity

0:31:05.420,0:31:09.940
And you can see a whole bunch of little dots starting to appear as you get closer you get

0:31:10.820,0:31:14.580
inundated with a sea of dots and you can

0:31:15.100,0:31:20.740
Click on I think the circle yeah, and then you can see all these lines connecting it to things

0:31:20.740,0:31:23.340
Why they're connected to those things. I don't know like

0:31:25.460,0:31:29.460
Let's go to it page not found. Oh, I guess some of these are broken. How about you?

0:31:31.060,0:31:34.980
Outline effect. Oh it has a it looks like it's read me here

0:31:36.740,0:31:39.280
Yeah, I think it sticks its read me inside of there

0:31:41.220,0:31:46.480
Why is it connected to something else maybe it's a sub repository or something like that. It's just a read me

0:31:46.480,0:31:50.740
Oh a view code. I'm not in desktop mode. It's collapsed. Oh

0:31:53.500,0:31:55.500
Maybe it's these packages

0:31:56.380,0:31:58.380
It's probably these packages

0:31:59.180,0:32:02.740
Anyways, I don't want to get it. I don't go Bronson through this stuff

0:32:03.500,0:32:10.260
And the podcast but I thought this was really neat if you guys know any projects like these just random stuff

0:32:10.620,0:32:12.620
It's like a mind map basically

0:32:12.620,0:32:17.980
FBX exporter whoo? Unity FBX exporter

0:32:18.740,0:32:22.980
Unity technologies, I guess this oh, this must be the unity's FBX

0:32:24.180,0:32:29.100
Exporter plug-in no unity 3d Japan. Oh, maybe anyways

0:32:29.740,0:32:33.460
Like I said, I can browse these all day long. So if you have any that you like

0:32:34.140,0:32:36.700
Similar to this or you know any language? I

0:32:37.900,0:32:39.900
It doesn't matter to me

0:32:39.900,0:32:43.780
I sent him my way. I love to look through these

0:32:45.540,0:32:47.540
So I

0:32:47.740,0:32:49.740
This is

0:32:49.980,0:32:51.980
On a related note

0:32:52.500,0:32:54.660
Have you I don't know if you've explored

0:32:56.140,0:33:04.040
Get the hub before it took me a long and like I've had a github account forever and I never went through the explore tab

0:33:06.380,0:33:08.380
Which is hilarious because

0:33:08.380,0:33:13.460
That's I mean, I just showed you I like to look around at those kinds of things but a

0:33:14.180,0:33:16.180
Few years back. I started using the explore tab

0:33:16.180,0:33:21.260
And so you can find things like this one that I shared was game engines

0:33:21.260,0:33:25.860
And I've done a video in the past like I don't know a while ago

0:33:25.860,0:33:31.660
A couple maybe a year or two ago about all the different game engines that you can find

0:33:31.660,0:33:38.300
Inside a github for all different kinds of things 2d 3d half-baked all that sort of stuff

0:33:38.300,0:33:40.300
Of course, you're gonna have your number one

0:33:40.820,0:33:42.980
most starred stuff up here Godot

0:33:44.620,0:33:46.620
But you know you'll have

0:33:47.460,0:33:50.780
I'm gooey. I am GUI however you want to say it

0:33:52.020,0:33:54.900
the popular UI library, so

0:33:56.500,0:33:59.740
It's kind of essentially it doesn't

0:33:59.740,0:34:03.780
Keep track of the things it creates. It's it's an immediate mode. That's what I am stands for

0:34:03.780,0:34:09.180
It's an immediate mode where you have to tell it to render stuff what it's rendering kind of every frame

0:34:11.380,0:34:14.100
But I'm not gonna go through all these but there's there's all kinds like that

0:34:14.100,0:34:20.220
This is a refreshing a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in rust

0:34:20.660,0:34:21.660
so

0:34:21.660,0:34:27.500
I guess bevy must be a popular one for the rust the rust arians rust atonians

0:34:27.500,0:34:29.500
all the rusty's

0:34:30.780,0:34:32.780
It's pretty cool

0:34:34.100,0:34:36.100
But there

0:34:36.100,0:34:42.100
There I was about say hundreds. There are thousands like there's 5,000. Let me scroll down to the bottom here

0:34:43.700,0:34:49.580
Maybe it's not at the bottom. There's oh here. It is is at the top. There's almost well. There's

0:34:51.180,0:34:53.660
If you round up almost 6,000

0:34:53.660,0:34:59.980
Almost 6,000 I game engines and you know, some of them are pretty cool

0:34:59.980,0:35:03.300
I kind of spent some time perusing these

0:35:04.220,0:35:05.700
a

0:35:05.700,0:35:07.700
year or two ago and

0:35:07.900,0:35:13.300
They were there's just some really cool stuff and you can get some pretty cool shaders that people have done

0:35:13.500,0:35:15.780
There's a lot of you know available shaders

0:35:17.340,0:35:19.820
With like demos and and cool stuff I

0:35:19.820,0:35:23.060
I like writing shaders, but I do like

0:35:24.100,0:35:28.380
Checking out what other people do because lots of other people are way better at shaders than I am

0:35:28.380,0:35:32.860
I don't even I don't even really use shader graphs. I I

0:35:34.620,0:35:38.620
Find them too cumbersome for me. I like to hand type it but I

0:35:39.340,0:35:41.820
Hate debugging shaders. They take forever

0:35:41.820,0:35:48.620
So, yeah, I like to look at other people's shaders for inspiration and and that sort of stuff so pretty

0:35:49.500,0:35:51.500
dope

0:35:51.500,0:35:53.500
Yeah, if you have some time

0:35:54.020,0:35:56.020
Come in here

0:35:56.020,0:35:58.020
Feel free to browse through

0:35:59.020,0:36:05.420
The thousands and thousands and thousands of game engines you'll find one for every language and you'll find one for every scenario

0:36:06.700,0:36:10.660
Let's see what you can filter by you filter by star most fewest

0:36:10.660,0:36:12.100
most fewest

0:36:12.100,0:36:16.700
Most forks that'd be interesting and I've I'd assume it's relative to the stars

0:36:17.780,0:36:19.780
All right. Let's find out

0:36:19.900,0:36:22.420
Yep, good. Oh, I'm gee. I'm gooey

0:36:23.060,0:36:29.220
Coco's 2d, I guess it's a little different about the same though. I feel like those two are superfluous

0:36:31.140,0:36:38.060
Or the forks is superfluous that is the stars kind of is basically same thing I wouldn't recommend fewest stars

0:36:38.060,0:36:42.460
You're gonna get tons of zeros and I don't know what order those are in so

0:36:43.220,0:36:45.220
Recently updated it might be pretty cool

0:36:47.300,0:36:50.780
Coco's creator. Yeah, so if you ever get some time

0:36:51.660,0:36:56.700
Come out here and explore the github. There's a lot of cool stuff you can

0:36:57.700,0:37:02.500
Select on topics and you can select different topics based on what you're interested in

0:37:02.500,0:37:08.180
One topic that I have saved is C. I love looking through C stuff. I love

0:37:09.380,0:37:13.740
getting ideas from from C and look here's OBS

0:37:15.540,0:37:23.300
But I love just looking through C stuff since it's my favorite language lots of good stuff in there so check it out play around and

0:37:24.860,0:37:28.140
Send me if you find if you find some cool stuff

0:37:28.140,0:37:33.500
Send them my way. I'd love to look I love looking through this stuff. Like I said

0:37:35.140,0:37:37.140
So I

0:37:37.660,0:37:41.260
Think you know we're coming to the end of this and one of the things that

0:37:42.020,0:37:45.140
There's one other thing that bothered me. Hey, I

0:37:46.540,0:37:51.620
I'd strongly dislike to end on a sour note, but it's a it's a goofy one to me

0:37:52.700,0:37:54.700
There's there's this

0:37:54.700,0:37:59.100
Article that was posted and bothered my wife to where I

0:37:59.740,0:38:03.300
Don't know if it's called a straw man argument or a gas lighting or what?

0:38:04.220,0:38:06.620
But it was about not being able to play Zelda

0:38:07.740,0:38:09.740
inside of the

0:38:10.020,0:38:12.220
You know Legend of Zelda series. I know

0:38:12.820,0:38:16.140
Ironically, you don't play Zelda and Zelda you play as Lincoln Zelda

0:38:17.460,0:38:19.260
and I

0:38:19.260,0:38:23.220
Don't think this is they made it seem like everyone's gonna be playing Zelda

0:38:23.220,0:38:25.220
They made it seem like everybody

0:38:25.620,0:38:30.820
Everybody on the planet was wanting this to happen and you could play a Zelda and tons of games

0:38:30.820,0:38:33.820
You can play in Zelda, you know Super Smash you can play in Zelda as

0:38:34.500,0:38:39.100
What was it called Hyrule Warriors you play Zelda and like tons of like offshoot games

0:38:41.260,0:38:45.780
So, I don't know if she's in Mario Kart now she might even be in Mario Kart

0:38:46.300,0:38:49.220
I don't understand the need for people to

0:38:49.220,0:38:52.300
Come up with problems. Maybe it's because

0:38:53.020,0:38:55.020
They're being paid to write articles

0:38:55.220,0:38:57.220
And so they've got to figure out how to

0:38:57.620,0:39:02.380
Spend their day doing something and so they come up with these weird ghosts that they have to chase

0:39:02.780,0:39:04.780
and the way they word it is like

0:39:05.620,0:39:10.460
Everybody on the internet wanted this like with no citation of all the people that wanted it

0:39:10.460,0:39:15.020
I'm sure there's you know a pocket of people that want to play a Zelda and a Zelda game, but

0:39:15.020,0:39:20.820
Generally you play Legend of Zelda as link. That's how it's always been. It's a great game for its mechanics

0:39:20.820,0:39:25.860
You want to focus on the gameplay you want to focus on all of that sort of stuff. You don't want to have to focus on

0:39:27.220,0:39:32.820
character semantics and altering your story and changing your formulas just so you can play as

0:39:33.300,0:39:38.500
One of the other characters in there and they have lots of characters. It doesn't just have to be Zelda people are complaining

0:39:38.500,0:39:46.500
And I mean you could just mod the games if you really want to play a Zelda, but yeah, there's this is the

0:39:47.460,0:39:49.460
the article in question

0:39:50.140,0:39:52.140
by the gamer comm

0:39:52.660,0:39:55.700
Nintendo has no plans to make Zelda a playable character

0:39:56.540,0:40:00.060
It's a newsflash big old bold headline right there

0:40:00.980,0:40:03.300
No plans. Oh, how dare they?

0:40:03.300,0:40:10.100
As theories that Zelda would be playable in tears of the kingdom have proven wrong the wrong all those theories

0:40:10.100,0:40:12.500
I'd never heard once they're all just

0:40:13.180,0:40:18.860
And Nintendo even worst of all Nintendo doesn't plan to change anytime soon

0:40:19.620,0:40:24.860
Game that makes them millions and millions of dollars and is huge smash hits

0:40:26.140,0:40:28.620
They don't want to change it up and you know

0:40:28.620,0:40:36.020
Potentially alienate audiences. Uh, yeah, it's just I feel like this is I don't know like I said

0:40:36.020,0:40:39.500
I don't know if it's straw man or gaslight. It feels like one of those things where

0:40:40.580,0:40:42.580
companies point at

0:40:43.700,0:40:48.020
News people in general point at something and then they say

0:40:48.980,0:40:53.740
What do you think about that? And they point it and they they start asking that to like, you know,

0:40:53.740,0:41:00.780
What do you think about that and they point it and they they start asking that to like corporations and stuff like trying to get them?

0:41:00.780,0:41:04.660
The way on and on stuff they don't need a way in on and in my opinion Nintendo

0:41:05.660,0:41:09.220
They make tons of money. They have the IP solid. It's a fantastic

0:41:09.900,0:41:14.660
Like everybody loves the characters. Everybody loves the the storyline even though it repeats

0:41:14.820,0:41:20.940
It's it's a formula that works that people really like they focus on link doing these interesting game mechanics. So

0:41:20.940,0:41:23.300
But yeah, they're saying like

0:41:24.340,0:41:29.100
However, yet again is not the case yet again. Oh, no

0:41:29.940,0:41:34.220
Every single time I'm let down every time I sell the game comes out. It's a smash hit and

0:41:35.100,0:41:37.620
I'm always thinking about why couldn't I play Zelda?

0:41:39.540,0:41:41.540
Yeah, it's

0:41:41.580,0:41:43.580
It's a they even mention

0:41:44.540,0:41:47.660
That here we go. Unfortunately has been

0:41:47.660,0:41:52.820
That has many fans wondering if Zelda these many fans. I don't know where they are

0:41:53.340,0:41:57.220
Maybe they meant to put in my ni mini fans a small group

0:41:58.740,0:42:03.340
Of her playing in the mainline game and that's the thing is like why does it have to be mainline game?

0:42:03.340,0:42:08.700
That's why it's like you wanting to make Facebook or something

0:42:09.740,0:42:14.460
What's app I just remembered the chat app. That's like saying you want to put what's up on the front page of

0:42:14.460,0:42:19.820
Facebook it is I don't know, you know, a lot of people use it or like it so might as well

0:42:20.860,0:42:25.220
Swap out your main thing for that. It doesn't make much sense business-wise

0:42:27.100,0:42:30.620
You you kind of follow the money when you're in a business if you got a formula that works

0:42:30.620,0:42:33.100
Especially that's growing as big as Zelda does

0:42:33.900,0:42:35.900
Which I think is like their biggest title

0:42:37.300,0:42:41.540
You don't go tweak in that much you you make better games

0:42:41.540,0:42:47.860
Mechanics games are about the mechanics games are not about the characters games are not about the stories both of those things

0:42:48.420,0:42:55.380
Make games better, but that's not what games are about. They're about what the player does the games are about the player

0:42:56.060,0:43:00.700
Everybody has to get that in their their minds. The game is for the player and

0:43:01.380,0:43:07.340
Is about the player you don't need to pressure them into worrying about all these things. They don't need to worry about

0:43:07.340,0:43:12.820
You don't need to pressure them into worrying about all these things. They don't need to worry about just let them have fun playing their game

0:43:14.500,0:43:21.780
Okay, so that was my rant on this particular article, sorry whoever you are this person

0:43:23.380,0:43:24.820
This is

0:43:24.820,0:43:30.100
This is dumb the waste of I I don't like these kinds of

0:43:30.100,0:43:36.900
These kinds of articles that point at random ghosts and say why isn't that the way it's I think it should be

0:43:38.580,0:43:40.980
You know so anyways I

0:43:42.020,0:43:48.060
Haven't played by the way just a side note. No, don't spoil anything for me. I have not played the new Zelda game. I

0:43:49.180,0:43:51.820
Can't play it. You see I'm about to have a baby

0:43:52.140,0:43:55.900
I'm very excited about this baby, and I can't get sucked into a video game

0:43:55.900,0:44:02.420
Just as I'm about to have a baby. She'll be here any day now, and I probably won't be able to play

0:44:02.420,0:44:05.740
This is all that unfortunately, and I really do want to play it

0:44:05.740,0:44:10.460
I probably won't be able to play it for a few months until you know, she's stable

0:44:11.700,0:44:15.180
You know, my wife is all healed up and feeling better. I

0:44:15.700,0:44:19.940
I've already got a child to I'm gonna be looking after my son

0:44:21.500,0:44:23.500
Basically the whole time

0:44:23.500,0:44:26.060
because he's he's fairly young and

0:44:27.300,0:44:32.100
They're they're pretty close in age I can say so I'm gonna have my hands full and I

0:44:32.740,0:44:37.140
Though I really want to play this game. I'm gonna have to hold off on it. So no spoilers for me

0:44:37.140,0:44:38.420
Don't tell me anything

0:44:38.420,0:44:42.700
You can tell me what you like in general the public stuff like hey, I like

0:44:43.260,0:44:45.260
building cars and

0:44:45.500,0:44:48.960
trees and spaceships or whatever you but

0:44:48.960,0:44:54.280
Don't spoil any of the like mechanics. They haven't already kind of exposed or anything like that

0:44:54.280,0:44:58.160
I I like to go in blind on these things. In fact, I

0:44:59.240,0:45:01.240
goofy story I

0:45:01.640,0:45:07.040
I like all the side things in games. I haven't even finished beating breath of the wild

0:45:07.040,0:45:10.360
I've done everything like mastered all the cooking stuff

0:45:10.360,0:45:17.800
I've got all the best clothes and the last thing that I need to do is beat the final boss, which is Ganon

0:45:17.800,0:45:21.520
And presumably I have I like I said, I don't spoil myself on this stuff

0:45:21.960,0:45:26.520
I haven't even beat him yet because I did everything else and

0:45:28.040,0:45:32.720
There's a few things I haven't done I something I like to do like there's a few of the

0:45:33.720,0:45:34.960
Shrines I haven't completed

0:45:34.960,0:45:37.640
so something I like to do is I like to

0:45:37.880,0:45:44.060
Do all of the side things and then beat the final boss because then it's like a super completionist feeling moment

0:45:44.060,0:45:50.520
it feels incredible the downside is six years later have to be the boss, but the upside is it feels amazing when I do and

0:45:52.440,0:45:57.240
Because one of the one of the things that I feel suck is is if you finish the game

0:45:57.600,0:46:00.760
Beat the boss and then there's a bunch of side things to do

0:46:00.760,0:46:05.800
It feels like it's in backwards order like I feel like you should do all of the adventuring

0:46:06.400,0:46:10.120
Before you beat the penultimate boss and then say I'm done

0:46:10.760,0:46:12.760
That's just me though. I'm sure

0:46:12.760,0:46:17.520
But that's just what I like to do in games. So games like Grand Theft Auto

0:46:18.160,0:46:22.320
games like I don't even know what the main story quest is and

0:46:23.400,0:46:26.680
Things like Skyrim. I have no I have no idea at all

0:46:26.680,0:46:33.340
I just I just get plopped in the world and I do everything but the main story. That's just how I am. So anyways

0:46:33.340,0:46:40.740
That's my thoughts and thanks for watching I guess I'll see you guys in the next one have a good one bye for now
