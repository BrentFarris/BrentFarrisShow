00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
all right welcome back today we've got a few news stories we're going to talk about Google Chrome both with misspelled

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
URLs third-party cookies we're going to talk about how you shouldn't feel so bad about not

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
finishing projects I'm going to talk about augmented reality I love augmented reality chat GPT has an iOS app.net for

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
previews here and just general just general text stuff it's going to be

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
exciting hopefully I can sync up my audio right this time I think I've had some issues in the past but we shall see

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
chat GPT it's out on iOS I don't know if you heard about it everybody's talking about it there's tons of people tweeting

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
about it and articles being made it's this big old hubbub I don't have an

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
iPhone uh it's not on Android and well

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
my wife has an iPhone so for those of you who don't have an iPhone and have an

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Android like me or just not even a smartphone at all maybe you have a dumb phone a Linux phone who knows

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm going to spoil it for you you launch the app it asks you for your date of

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
birth and then it asks you for your phone number now the date of birth thing

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
might be some requirement by Apple for artificial intelligence stuff blah blah blah the phone number thing is annoying

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I already have a an account with with open AI I use their apis for just random

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
toy projects of my own nothing nothing public but

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
the iOS version of chat chip is it's basically just the web version except

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
harder to use I think that's the easiest way to explain it I guess it's in your pocket and it's on

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
your phone so it's easier for people who don't have desktops or laptops or anything that's of that nature

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
there is a voice input button you press that and a big old voice thing pops up

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
it's not Siri it's just a big old voice thing it's probably their whisper or

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
whatever whatever their API is called for voice to text

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
so you press that you talk into it you press it again the it the big old Circle

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
that it makes and it just puts the text in the input box doesn't even send it so

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I don't see the difference between typing with voice to text normally with Siri versus pressing that other than that one

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
maybe is more accurate I don't know uh I didn't exactly

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
over test this thing so I checked that out that was underwhelming and then you can normally type in text and then it'll

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
respond it does respond pretty quick my wife she typed in the prompt or she

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
talked in the prompt to hit send and it was almost immediate that it responded which is a little faster than just a

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
normal question on the web version so maybe there's that browse through the

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
settings I kind of looked around the app it's very Bare Bones it's mostly just

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
chat GPD where you get to talk to chat GPT so it really doesn't seem any

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
different from the web version so if you're on Android you're not missing out on anything if you just open up the web

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
version of chat gbt that's essentially what it is except in the web version

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
if you use the web version on your desktop you are familiar with the UI scheme and where things are so I guess

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
there's a perk there but yeah I was I was a little interested in what was going to go on with the chat

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
GPT iOS and a little disappointed it would have been at least it would have

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
been cool if you could have a conversation back and forth you talk to it it talks back to you you didn't have

38
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
to press send every time you use their voice to text a little extra features like that would have went a long way so

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
in my opinion the Bing chat GPT

40
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
is better on phones you can talk to it and it talks back with references and

41
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
all this other sort of nonsense that you maybe or may not want and you can set as temperament so

42
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
if you really want an app to use on your phone to talk to http or type to it I

43
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
would use the Bing chat one just in general now if you like chat GPT for like

44
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
storytelling and long longer form conversations so it doesn't cut you off of course you're not going to get that

45
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
with the bing one the bing one Cuts you off pretty quick as soon as it starts to notice it's building up a temper so

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
that's that's what the chat GPT official

47
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
IOS app is a little underwhelming oh well it's what we got

48
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
in a smaller amount of news that not many people may have heard of yet is

49
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
that Google Chrome is going to be detecting typos inside of the URL box

50
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and it says that it will make suggestions of what it thought you meant

51
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
now I think this can be abused where you could go to type in something and it's

52
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
going to overly be aggressive and suggest you things

53
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
that are Google services or Google Affiliated services or websites that highly integrate with Google and make a

54
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
lot of Google ad Revenue so I think there is room for it to be abused however in principle The Very base

55
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
concept of detecting a URL

56
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
mistype and suggesting you a correction I think is a good idea

57
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
why do I think it's a good idea it's because I don't spell things good I

58
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
sometimes I I type like a normal person or I type in the standard way I should

59
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:60,000
say you know index fingers on the F and the J and thumbs on the space bar all that nonsense

60
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
so even though I do that I wind up tripping up or missing a key or my

61
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
fingers going in a way where I just I try to hit a number for example and I

62
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
hit the wrong number and things get a little offset it's very rare but it happens enough for me to worry about it

63
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
so often what I do is rather than typing in direct URL

64
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
say some specific website I will

65
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
even if I've typed it a thousand times even if it auto fills it and says this is the one that you're likely going to

66
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
do because you did it previously I still will type it in as a search

67
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
query and when I do a search query I have I have the ability to select the link

68
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
that I want I can just click on it and that makes me feel a little more secure in what I'm typing so it's become a

69
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
habit of mine to just search for for whatever site I'm going to now if

70
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
it's a simple site that I've used a million times say like a YouTube or Twitter or or whatever have you or my

71
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
own sites that I've set up I'm not likely going to do that kind of roundabout effort but if it's a site I

72
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
use occasionally like bills or things of that nature where I

73
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
may check it every month or or I may go to it a few times a week or something like that not bills but you know just

74
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
general stuff then I will type it in to a search box and then click on the link rather than

75
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
typing it out because the last thing I want to do is for that tiny little text at the top of the URL

76
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
on a distance screen for me for me to put an L instead of an i or something and hit enter

77
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
and it takes me to some phishing site which is cloned whatever website they know I'm trying to go to

78
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
and so you know call me a little bit uh of a worrywart in that way but

79
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
it makes sure that I don't mess up and do something that I'm going to regret because those people they'll they'll

80
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
steal your whole life away if you if you let them so I think the general concept of

81
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
when you type something a URL bar it gives you suggestions I think it's a fantastic idea I wish other browsers uh

82
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
like Brave or DuckDuckGo or whatever Firefox I I wish they would all do it

83
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
but that they would suggest meaningful sites I can see that Google

84
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
does have an incentive they don't just make features especially ones as low-key as this

85
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
uh for free so of course they're going to use it for some sort of advertising or or pushing certain types of products

86
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:60,000
over others which is going to be annoying but the base ideas there and I think that everything should adopt it I

87
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
think it's a great way to solve a problem and put my mind to ease I don't

88
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
know if I'll Trust it to start but maybe it'll get me over my habit of having to

89
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
search for sites and go based off of search engines so we'll we'll find out

90
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
on that augmented reality it's it's a specific type of virtual reality

91
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
that I enjoy more than virtual reality so you'll find people who are in the

92
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
augmented reality camp and really want to be in that space and then you'll find the people in the virtual reality camp

93
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
and really want to be in that space now of course people could be interested in both however you usually have people who

94
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
are weighted more towards one than the other for me it's augmented reality I really love the idea of augmented

95
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
reality having the space around you and being in the real world and augmenting it

96
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
that's awesome that's something straight out of you know iRobot or or Minority

97
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Report or whatever you know all those those cool Sci-Fi movies so being able

98
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
to put a video and pin it to a wall and just like walk around and have it stuck to that wall where you left it

99
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
and place things and pin them to the world is I don't know it's just kind of a really neat concept to me virtual

100
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
reality kind of absorbs your senses and that it puts you

101
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
into a 3D World so it it's fun and and all that but it really isn't something

102
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
you could do for all day I can see augmented reality in some ways be an

103
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
all-day thing for work or or whatever something that just because you're still part of the real world you're just

104
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
putting things around in it and that I think is where the appeal is for

105
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
me now the one problem I have with augmented reality is a lot of the game developers it's not a problem with

106
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
augmented reality per se is a problem with the ideas people are having a lot of the time people are having these

107
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
ideas of board games you can put a a board game on a table and you have these

108
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
3D characters and special effects and meteorites and Dragons come down and moving and that's kind of cool for a

109
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
movie aspect but what about games that involve moving around and puzzle solving

110
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
and you know different parts it's not just stuck on a table and a lot of other augmented reality is

111
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
kind of I don't know what to call it it's the Nintendo DS effect where they give you those cards and then you can

112
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
look at them and a little character pops out same kind of concept as the the board game now that being said

113
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
there's this cool project somebody's messing around with and I really like it it's basically portals it's there's not

114
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
a whole lot to it you've got two portals and you can smack the objects around between these portals so you pass it

115
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
into that portal it'll come out the other one on the other side and you can pass it through and that's a really neat concept because now you're getting out

116
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
of the space of tabletop things and you're getting into the space of

117
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
objects moving within your space and you're interacting with them with your hand in this scenario so of course you

118
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
have the challenge of not being able to feel the objects so it's it's a little difficult to to

119
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
perceive but this guy seems to be handling it just fine he's

120
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I think it does a palm check from the looks of it kind of like a like a flat plane is where the hand is and that's

121
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
what he's kind of using to bash this stuff around it's really cool so this is the kind of stuff I'm hoping to

122
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
see more in the future I want to see more games like this imagine escape room kind of scenario where you

123
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
can multiplayer with a friend things could be hidden in the room or you can find levers and pull them and things

124
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:60,000
other things changing the room it's just I think there's a lot of cool things we can do with this kind of

125
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
concept and get out of the gimmick realm of augmented reality

126
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
so if you guys have any suggestions or concepts augmented reality let me know if you like virtual reality more than

127
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
augmented reality I'd love to hear your Arguments for it I I think that

128
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
you know there's a lot of things in that space you can think of all the games that are out there you can

129
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
think of as Zuckerberg land whatever it's called I can't remember

130
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
metaverse so there's a lot of stuff out there for VR so it does have substance I'd like to

131
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
see a lot more kind of go into augmented reality and I have another

132
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
time I have another thing in this topic of augmented reality and it's this article here let's see let

133
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
me open it up it's mainly just text I want to see if I can

134
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
get a picture of the person using it so

135
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
this this is on the verge this lady is using this augmented reality set from

136
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
what it looks like it's a keyboard looks like it has a track pad and it's connected to these glasses now this

137
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
isn't anything new there's actually quite a few products out there for glasses that connect to some kind of

138
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
device whether it's your phone or a laptop and project screens and all that but in this one it's neat because it

139
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
looks like it doesn't have a screen at all it's just some glasses I guess this is the protective case that

140
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
you can put the glasses underneath you can close this perhaps a keyboard and a trackpad and oh this this camera must be

141
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
for maybe gestures or something like that uh but

142
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I I haven't fully fully figured out everything that's

143
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
going on in this thing there's a second person using it and I guess this is either a projected example or it's

144
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
potentially a mock-up of what this dude sees it's the same device

145
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I think this might be a mock-up of what they're saying but like this is this is really cool this is

146
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
you don't have a screen that you're kind of staring at you can put it at a nice viewing distance if you're like me and

147
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
you have eyes with two different that require two vastly different lenses for

148
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
glasses this is fantastic because you can get the effect of having things more clear

149
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
through this digital medium and what I mean by that is for example it's hard to

150
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
explain I have so in my right eye it's it's much more blurry than my left eye

151
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
my left eye is actually pretty good my right eye is incredibly blurry his accident when I was a child there is a

152
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
when I look at the viewfinder in a camera with my blurry eye it's clear as

153
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
day it's I can see everything around it's like wearing super glasses so

154
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
augmented reality I feel like has a fantastic benefit of being able to make

155
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
those screens clearer because you'll be able to adjust the

156
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
kind of the lenses and their focus and all that sort of stuff so it's just uh I

157
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
don't know it's going to be wonderful I can't wait for it I I'd really like to try this this device out I'm sure it's

158
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
going to be super expensive so I'm probably not going to try anytime soon but the moment this sort of device becomes more commercial and consumer

159
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
grade it's probably going to be something that I mess with even if I look like a dork with the glasses on I mean whatever it

160
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
doesn't matter especially if I'm in privacy of my own home uh I mean

161
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
what does it matter so super excited about augmented reality super excited about seeing these things coming to

162
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
augmented reality the concepts and and all of these new gadgets uh I don't know

163
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm just really hyped about this unfinished projects this is something

164
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
that plagues developers of all kinds as a game developer I know it plagues me

165
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
constantly to to never finish projects and I've seen a

166
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
lot of Articles there's articles and and basically every single development news

167
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
blog site in existence who is either talking about

168
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
the graveyard of all of the projects that they've never finished or they talk

169
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
about ideas on how to actually finish projects now

170
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I I do feel somewhat incomplete when I have this big

171
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:61,000
idea for a project big grandiose idea got all the bells and whistles one of the problems I have is that I maybe

172
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
replay the entire Concept in my head so many times that it gets boring and I

173
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
move on to something else but you know that's the way it works now

174
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
some some advice on Dead projects there'll always be another project and

175
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
we have all come up with ideas that we gave up on that somebody else wound up finishing and making tons of money on

176
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
it's it's happened to all of us at least three or four of my projects Somebody went out and made millions of dollars

177
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
doing the same thing except they've completed it so it has extra things that I made I didn't think of

178
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
so I generally I think it's good to

179
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
first calm down and relax life is long life is short

180
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
there are many more important things than finishing projects your kids are having kids in the at all

181
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
that's a fantastic thing that I know you think it's probably a cliche if you

182
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
don't have kids to think that everybody ugh everyone says that and then they have kids also and they're all about

183
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
kids now it does give a completely new meaning to life and a whole new purpose

184
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
and just by its very nature but I'm not here to talk about that I'm

185
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
just here to say that's one of many things it could be the the studies you

186
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
have with friends or the groups that you go and meet up on or the random projects you do with groups or your work or your

187
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
church or there's so many things in the list of of more important things than

188
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
finishing your project don't let finishing your projects or Dead projects or graveyards of projects

189
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
make you feel bad I don't feel bad for all the projects that I've not completed and it is a lot my GitHub is enormous I

190
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:60,000
have to scroll a long way to look through and find an old project

191
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
and that's you know one of the best things that come out of not completing projects

192
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
and just doing the Parts you like and then going on to something else or any of that is

193
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
that it's iteration you learn from it each time you do that you make some progress on either a new idea or you

194
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
become a better developer just in general whether you learn some art learn some programming or what have you

195
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
now I know that I've learned tons of stuff as far as networking and art and

196
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
tools for art and game engines and code and code paradigms and good structure

197
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
and everything else because sometimes my projects are just about doing a project that fits a code

198
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
standard that I've never done before and those Dead projects all add up you

199
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
know in your mind and it gives you that history that you can then use later

200
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
so all the articles that I see a lot of people either complaining about

201
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
how it makes them feel absolutely terrible they get burned out and they take breaks I've talked about this

202
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
before I've never been burned out burnt out and in the past 15 years and I I

203
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
don't see myself getting burned out on programming in the next 15 either or until I die I'll probably probably die

204
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
with my hands on the keyboard typing out some line of code or something so

205
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
don't let it get to you I I it's just something that I think has been creeping

206
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
up a lot it's crept up a lot over the past couple years since 2020 because a lot of people have been trying to

207
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
to make some kind of projects now there's a lot of programmers out there and there's a lot of people making

208
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
projects you can't expect to be the guy that's that's what I tell

209
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
um my friends and some of my family who feel depressed whenever they didn't complete something or they can't stick

210
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
to a regiment is you don't need to be the guy the guy is

211
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
out there in the world and he'll do great things but the Grass Is Always Greener that person wishes they're you

212
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
and you wish there you wish you were them it's just how it goes just enjoy the process of coming up with

213
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
ideas writing them down drawing them sketching them making flow charts coding

214
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
up stuff trying out new engines and new languages just enjoy it it's would you rather be sitting around watching TV all

215
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
day I'm sure that a lot of people who listen to podcasts like this are thinking about something or they want to

216
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
work on something or they have it in the background there's it's just a it's another form of entertainment I

217
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
would like to I think is what I'm getting at is when you do these projects it's

218
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
entertaining and that's what it should be and that's the whole point of doing them is to have fun so don't have high

219
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
expectations for your project just do the things that you love about it if you're tired of it move on it's

220
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
it's that simple and obviously we're pretty good at that because we have graveyards of projects now don't we

221
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
so three quick articles that I came across today one is Twitter blue

222
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
subscribers now can upload to our videos I think it was an hour before if you're

223
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
into Twitter blue then you get longer videos it's good to see that they're

224
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
adding features to Twitter blue I know it was a big old stink I have no opinion I I don't think that

225
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I don't like to make everything a political argument I think some things just you know let sleeping dogs lie so

226
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I in principle because it attempts to move

227
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
away from advertising and collecting your data even though they continue to do that I think if

228
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Twitter was able to get the subscriber backing that they needed they would

229
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
probably phase out ads just as a feature if you do Twitter blue it'll completely

230
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
remove ads so I think that adding these new features

231
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
to Twitter blue is is great it's great to see that they're adding them I mean this isn't a huge one it's just

232
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
extending the frame uh the frame the the time length of videos but not bad

233
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
hopefully we'll see some more and I'm interested to see how that how that goes so the next one is the steam deck the

234
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
steam deck is has a full HD uh plus display upgrade and here's the article

235
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
on that from XDA Developers it's a hundred dollars

236
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
and it upgrades to 1920 by 1200 for the

237
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
resolution from what it currently is which is 1280 by 800. I'm assuming the HD Plus the plus is the added pixels on

238
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:61,000
the on the vertical because it's not 1920 by 1080. now I checked through this ad and I

239
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
didn't see anything about how it affects your battery life I assume if you're going to be driving a higher density

240
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
display you're probably going to wind up using more battery for me personally

241
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I wouldn't pay a hundred dollars for this upgrade because I hold the steam

242
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
deck at a comfortable distance from my face and I can play it it feels good everything looks fine the size of the

243
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
screen it plays well with the with the resolution if you're one of those people

244
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
who are more affected by seeing the pixels and the density maybe this

245
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
upgrade is for you I don't know I I it's it's definitely cool if somebody does this upgrade please let me know how you

246
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
feel about it does it drain your battery you know I I do want to see more steam

247
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
deck mods because I love the steam deck I have a steam deck I bought my wife the steam deck it's a great device I know

248
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
there's New Alternatives now with Asus I think but uh the steam deck is nice because it's a

249
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
it's sold a lot and it's a constant kind of a fixed type of device right now so

250
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
the dimensions and all that and their uniform and so a lot of cool kind of

251
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
gadgets and add-ons and those sorts of things can be added for it so yeah check this out if it's something that

252
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
interests you steam Deck full HD Plus display and a hundred dollars doesn't

253
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
seem that bad for a display upgrade I don't know I don't upgrade displays it's

254
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
cheaper than a monitor a 1080p monitor so maybe maybe that's worth it

255
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
and then the third and the third quick story that I have is stability AI

256
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
releases stable stable Studio an open source

257
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
future of dream studio so this is an image generation uh AI I haven't used it but

258
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
maybe once or twice just to play around with it you go to the site you have some tokens it's kind of like the Bing it's

259
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
kind of like the being I think being used as Dolly from openai where you get some tokens and you can

260
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
generate some some pictures based on using those tokens and then you buy more tokens for Bing you search more and get

261
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
tokens that you can use so our coins I don't know what Bing calls them but the

262
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
stability AI has released a GitHub repository let me see if I can load it

263
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
up here here's their their landing page about it open they

264
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
have stable studio if I click on this it'll take me to GitHub now this was exciting at first because I

265
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
thought oh we're getting closer to more local AI which is what I want I want private local AI I don't want

266
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
cloud-based AI I think that's let's just asking for disaster I want

267
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
local private Ai and I want to be able to send my local private AI to go on the

268
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
internet to do things for me anonymously so I don't have to go on there and and drudge through the the madness that is

269
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
coming from all the AI stuff that's about to spawn on the Internet or already has a spawn on the internet now

270
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
this is not a step closer to private local AI it's nice that they made it it

271
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
seems like it's just taking their their web studio uh

272
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
app web app and allowing you to run it locally now it does not run the the

273
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
image generation locally you are required to use your API key for

274
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
stability AI so it's basically saying instead of using their website

275
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
and costing them money to host the website you host it and still pay for

276
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
the API key and that makes sense everybody's got to make their money right it's a capitalist Society no

277
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
problem with that I want these guys to continue I want them to thrive I want them to explore and you know go to the

278
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
New Frontier of of artificial intelligence but I'm more interested in private local personal AI things that

279
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
that's it's kind of like I know that man it's probably a pipe dream because

280
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
you know you imagine that your your phone is your private local device but

281
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
it's not you have apple watching everything you do knowing everything you're doing how fast you're going

282
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
obviously they do the emergency alerts and hiding behind the auspices of

283
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
protecting lives is a great way to spy on people honestly they think they've

284
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
got it they've got the they've got the formula right there for that but I I really want to see more

285
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
private just locally AI that's mine and I doubt we're going to see it we're going to see

286
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
companies that come up with private local AI devices and maybe there will be some that are

287
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
genuine but the biggest the biggest hitters like I bet you this will be something Google and Microsoft and Apple

288
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
and everybody else does they'll probably tie it to the phone and it's not private

289
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
and local if it uses their web services or tracks what you do or or any of that

290
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
sort of nonsense so I do I'm a hopeful person I'm mostly an

291
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
optimist for all of life everything I try to see the the Silver Lining everything and I see wonderful things

292
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
with private local ai ai that I can tell to do things or come up with ideas or go on

293
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
the internet do things for me all that sort of stuff I think that's a wonderful thing and capturing memories like you

294
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
know we use phones to take pictures and videos but if I can store them an AI and AI can replay them and then when I'm

295
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
dead potentially be something that I can my kids can review or they could just

296
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
throw it away it doesn't matter to me however they want to grieve that's fine with me but I just think it'd be really

297
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
cool to do more local private Ai and unfortunately this sounded like it was but really it's

298
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
just I think it's just the web I actually tested it it use yarn fire up the web API and then it just does API

299
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
requests to their service so I think you might be able to hook it up to something like

300
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
it definitely isn't going to be a one-click solution right now I'll have to look more into it and let

301
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
you know what what I find but maybe that's the future is it takes this web API front end that or this web front end

302
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
that allows you to to query an AI and then you can change the back end that would be pretty pretty

303
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
dope but I don't know if that's what it is we shall find out so that's three

304
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:61,000
kind of quick stories and yeah let me know what you think Google is back at

305
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
its shenanigans so there's there's been an there's been an

306
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
announcement that Google is going to be turning off third-party cookies for one percent of chrome users

307
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
by uh q1 of 2024. so

308
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
anybody may be thinking about this and say well that's awesome you know cookies are annoying they track US they they

309
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
their way of of saving little bits of data and seeing us

310
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
cross sites and all this other sort of craziness especially when you start embedding say Google logins or Facebook

311
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
logins or whatever Integrations with third-party stuff then they can start tracking the people who

312
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
come to your website or your web application or your mobile app or any of those

313
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:60,000
so yeah at first it sounds this is fantastic now

314
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
those of us who think about security and use browsers that are more secure

315
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
um all right you know like Firefox or Brave

316
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
we use those browsers because they automatically block cookies or you may have privacy Badger or you may have you

317
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
know any of the various other plugins to block cookies and and stop

318
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
trackers and you may use duck.com or DuckDuckGo as it's called

319
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
the funny news for funny funny story about that Google actually

320
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
registered duck.com a while back a long time ago to prevent DuckDuckGo from registering

321
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
it I think there was a whole lawsuit about it but DuckDuckGo now finally owns

322
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
duck.com which is awesome it's good that they're not into that weird battle and it's a

323
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:61,000
lot easier to type duck.com than it is to type DuckDuckGo .com or whatever so

324
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
anyways that aside you may be thinking this is a great idea Google that sounds

325
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
great now what a lot of people point out is that Google as we've stated earlier

326
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
is is in the practice of favoring themselves and their third

327
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
party partners and people who use their services and ultimately make the money obviously they're a corporation they

328
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
want to make money they're going to do that so in general the background of this is

329
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Google has been talking about getting rid of these is the third party

330
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
cookies notice it's called third-party cookies since 2020 and in three years that's not happened

331
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
at all now uh what Google is announcing is that in Chrome build 115 which is going to be

332
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
released in July which is a couple months from now it will include the Privacy sandbox

333
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
feature flag and you can go into the the Privacy sandbox so you can go into the

334
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
settings the flags of chrome and you can turn it on at that point to block those

335
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
cookies the goal is that this is a temporary thing for people and and they're just

336
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
going to have it integrated normally so it's going to be a good benefit to

337
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
stop tracking but it's going to be a bad thing because they don't mention anything about their cookies and of

338
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
course it's their browser they can see every site you go to so it seems a little unfair to to block everybody else

339
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
but you're special like uh I think that just one-ups the

340
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
browser Wars uh which is which is probably one of the reasons Microsoft has hit so hard with Bing and

341
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Bing chat recently and you know it's been pretty effective from what I can tell

342
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
so now in order for Microsoft to do the tracking that they want or need they

343
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
have to have people in their browser so just do yourself a favor get out of

344
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
the browser Wars of the big companies get off of chrome you don't have to get off of chromium

345
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
basically every browser but Firefox is chromium you can you can have multiple browsers

346
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
installed I have Brave is my default browser right now and I have Firefox which is my default browser on Linux and

347
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
so I interchange them it just it it's more convenient and

348
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I don't know I don't know why it's convenient it's convenient on Linux because it usually comes with Firefox built in I guess

349
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
maybe that's why but use browsers like those which already do the blocking and they're not

350
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
biased because they block Google and they block Microsoft just the same and

351
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
maybe they'll block Google harder than the rest and that's okay with me because Google is a tyrant with tracking so

352
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
yeah swap your browsers this is a cool story but

353
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
really it seems like it's just a way for for Google to take more control from

354
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
other people who aren't Google and it's maybe a way for them to bully people into using their services like AdSense

355
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
and all those other uh their their web tracking stuff add words

356
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
webmaster tools it's probably a way of bullying people to stick with them which

357
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
is unfortunate so just go to another browser ignore Google and the rest so

358
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
that's my advice on that piece of news good to see but plenty of other browsers

359
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
have already beaten you to it and plenty of plugins have two so it's good for the the less technical

360
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
people I guess as you may know I am a programmer by day and by night and by

361
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
weekend and always I'm always a programmer but at night I Moonlight as a

362
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
podcaster so now we're going to talk a little bit about code .net 8 is being released if you haven't

363
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
heard this is all all the.net people rejoice I I find that this one is mostly just

364
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
kind of like build stuff which is cool better build stuff easier build stuff

365
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
the the that's that's always nice when you focus on that and you don't add ridiculous parts to your languages like

366
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
C sharp I love C sharp but man do they add some confusing things in there uh

367
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
nullables are a really cool concept for example and they're good if you

368
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
start your project with nulls or nullables are non-nullables but

369
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
but if you add it in the middle of a project it really just wrecks things and

370
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I've I've had people add them into the middle of projects before and it becomes Madness so some of the features are cool

371
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
just in isolation I suppose so this one seems to be mostly

372
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
this is from from somebody on dev.2 which I think is a Dev blogging site

373
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
um so there's Ms build output upgrade

374
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
there is tweaks to the output path there's nougat

375
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
stuff um package signing for Linux

376
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
dependencies auditing I don't know what this is I handle

377
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
vulnerable packages like a pro oh I guess this is just old packages or haven't been updated in a while

378
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
uh embrace the power of you uh oh YouTube span formattable so utf-8's been

379
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
in c-sharp for a long time so you should have been embracing the power of utf-8 all along by the way I

380
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
embraced the power of utf-8 in my C code which I have to write functions for

381
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
utf-8 myself so you should be using it in a language that fully supports it but it looks like it's getting some added

382
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
niceties which is always nice to say the least

383
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
let's see ahead of time compiler so uh did you know I've done

384
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
any preview for console ahead of time now one of the problems like with iOS is

385
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
it does not allow for support of just-in-time compilers it doesn't like they don't want you

386
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
adding scripting stuff in there or anything like that you got to have pre-compiled ahead of time all the way

387
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
and this is one of the reasons Unity had to swap and create il-2 CPP to convert

388
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
everything from c-sharp IL to C plus plus now there's a lot there's a

389
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:60,000
misconception that people have that that just magically makes your code faster it does not I don't know if you've seen the

390
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
generated C plus code it is madness now it may be faster in certain algorithms

391
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
because the compiler that compiles the C plus I don't know exactly which one they use it's probably clang

392
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
can pick up on code patterns and optimize a lot of the code in that way so

393
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
there are areas where it can get faster but in general it might actually be slower than the standard c-sharp stuff

394
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
so anyways that's that's a whole tangent on just in time compiler sorry about that we've got some Json deserialized

395
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
stuff more Json stuff and some logging updates so this is kind of I think a

396
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
a quality of life upgrade not not a whole bunch of new

397
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
system libraries or any of that I don't think it really needs a whole lot more there's quite a bit in C sharp to take

398
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
advantage of you can't really use everything in one project there's so much stuff so those of you who like dot net are

399
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
probably gonna like this I will uh put the put the link to this article I'm sure you can find any there's tons of

400
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
net eight uh things out there I just thought this was nice because it was a kind of a

401
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
little breakdown with with animated images so yeah I'll put this on Twitter I'll

402
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
put this in the description for you to check it out but net eight is here okay

403
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
so that's going to do it for today hopefully uh hopefully that was informative let me know if you have any

404
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
ideas for things you want me to talk about or maybe some cool stories in Tech

405
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
or programming or game development or just any of those kind of fields that you think I'd like just Cinema my way I

406
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
love going over this kind of stuff so thanks for watching and until next time

407
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
bye for now
