00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
Welcome back today. We've got a few news stories. We're gonna talk about Google Chrome both with misspelled URLs

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,020
Third-party cookies, we're gonna talk about

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,600
How you shouldn't feel so bad about not finishing projects. I'm gonna talk about augmented reality

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:21,340
I love augmented reality chat GPT has an iOS app dotnet for previews here and just general

5
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,800
Just general tech stuff. It's gonna be exciting. Hopefully I can sync up my audio right this time

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,080
I think I've had some issues in the past, but we shall see

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,680
Chat GPT it's out on iOS. I don't know if you heard about it. Everybody's talking about it

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,760
There's tons of people tweeting about it and articles being made. It's this big old hubbub. I don't have an iPhone

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,480
it's not on Android and

10
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,740
well

11
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,160
My wife has an iPhone

12
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:57,900
So for those of you who don't have an iPhone and have an Android like me or just not even a smartphone at all

13
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,500
Maybe you have a dumb phone or Linux phone. Who knows?

14
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,680
I'm gonna spoil it for you. You launch the app

15
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:11,600
It asks you for your date of birth and then it asks you for your phone number

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,240
Now the date of birth thing might be some requirement by Apple for artificial intelligence stuff the blah blah blah blah

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:25,720
The phone number thing is annoying. I already have a an account with with open AI

18
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,200
I use their API is for just random toy projects of my own

19
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,880
nothing nothing public

20
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,320
but

21
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,320
the iOS version of chat GPT is

22
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,480
It's basically just the web version except

23
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:47,440
Harder to use I think and that's the easiest way to explain it. I guess it's in your pocket and it's on your phone

24
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,680
So it's easier for people who don't have desktops or laptops or anything. That's of that nature

25
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,160
There is a

26
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,120
Voice input button you press that and a big old voice thing pops up. It's not a Siri

27
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,640
It's just a big old voice thing. It's probably their whisper or whatever

28
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,640
Whatever their API is called for

29
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,000
voice to text

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,600
So you press that you talk into it you press it again

31
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,040
The the big old circle that it makes and it just puts the text in the input box

32
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:25,520
Doesn't even send it so I don't see the difference between typing with voice to text normally with Siri

33
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,920
Versus pressing that other than that one. Maybe is more accurate. I don't know

34
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,920
I didn't exactly

35
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,680
Overtest this thing so I checked that out

36
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,040
That was underwhelming and then you can normally type in text and then it'll respond

37
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,640
It does respond pretty quick. She

38
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,120
My wife she typed in the prompt or she talked in the prompt hit send

39
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,800
And it was almost immediate that it responded which is a little faster than just a normal question on the web version

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,200
so maybe there's that browse through the settings I

41
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,800
Kind of looked around the app. It's very bare-bones. It's mostly just

42
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,720
Chat GPT where you get to talk to chat GPT. So it really doesn't seem any different from the web version

43
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,640
So if you're on Android, you're not missing out on anything if you just open up the web version of chat GPT

44
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,240
That's essentially what it is except in the web version

45
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,760
If you use the web version on your desktop

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,960
You are familiar with the UI scheme and where things are so I guess there's a perk there, but

47
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:37,120
Yeah, I was I was a little interested and what was gonna go on with the chat GPT iOS and

48
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,320
a little disappointed it would have been at least it would have been cool if you could have a

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,400
Conversation back and forth you talk to it. It talks back to you

50
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,680
You didn't have to press send every time you use their voice to text a little extra features like that

51
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,120
Would have went a long way. So in my opinion the

52
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,920
being

53
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,920
chat GPT

54
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,920
chat GPT is

55
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,080
Better on phones you can talk to it and it talks back

56
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,840
With references and all this other sort of nonsense that you may or may not want and you can set its temperament. So

57
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,800
If you really want an app to use on your phone to talk to chat GPT or type to it

58
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,780
I would use the Bing chat one just in general

59
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:28,320
Now if you like chat GPT for like storytelling and long longer form conversations, so it doesn't cut you off

60
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,960
of course

61
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,760
You're not gonna get that with the Bing one the Bing one cuts you off pretty quick as soon as it starts to

62
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,400
Notice it's building up a temper. So that's

63
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,960
That's what the chat GPT official

64
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:48,040
iOS app is a little underwhelming. Oh, well, it's what we got in

65
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,920
Smaller amount of news that

66
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:58,600
Not many people may have heard of yet is that Google Chrome is going to be detecting

67
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:05,800
typos inside of the URL box and it says that it will make suggestions of

68
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,960
What it thought you meant now

69
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:16,040
I think this can be abused where you could go to type in something and it's going to overly

70
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:22,200
Be aggressive and suggest you things that are Google services or Google affiliated

71
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:28,040
Services or websites that highly integrate with Google and make a lot of Google ad revenue

72
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,960
So I think there is room for it to be abused. However in

73
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
principle the very base

74
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,320
concept of

75
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,280
detecting a

76
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,920
URL

77
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,760
mistype and

78
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:50,120
Suggesting you a correction. I think is a good idea. Why do I think it's a good idea? It's because I don't spell things

79
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,600
Good. I sometimes I I type like a normal person

80
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,340
Or I type in the standard way I should say

81
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,420
You know index fingers on the F into J and thumbs on the spacebar all that nonsense

82
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,640
so

83
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,640
Even though I do that I wind up

84
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:14,440
Tripping up or missing a key or my fingers going in a way where I just I try to hit a number

85
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,200
For example when I hit the wrong number and things get a little offset. It's very rare, but it happens enough

86
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:27,680
For me to worry about it. So often what I do is rather than typing in direct URL of

87
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,760
say

88
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,960
some specific website I will

89
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:39,600
Even if I've typed it a thousand times even if it auto fills it and says this is the one that you're likely gonna do

90
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
because you did it previously I

91
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,480
Still will type it in as a search query. And when I do a search query I have I have

92
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:57,360
The ability to select the link that I want I can just click on it and that makes me feel a little more

93
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,840
Secure and what I'm typing so it's become a habit of mine to just search for

94
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,640
For whatever site I'm going to now if it's a simple site that I've used a million times

95
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,320
say like a YouTube or Twitter or or

96
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,560
Whatever have you?

97
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,240
Or my own sites that I've set up. I'm not likely going to do that

98
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,680
Kind of roundabout effort, but if it's a site I use occasionally

99
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,960
like

100
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,800
bills or

101
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:33,760
things of that nature where I may check it every month or or I may go to it a few times a week or

102
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,000
Something like that not bills, but you know just general stuff

103
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,760
then I will type it in to a search box and click on the link rather than typing it out because

104
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:50,280
The last thing I want to do is for that tiny little takes at the top of the URL and a distant screen for me

105
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:57,040
For me to put an L instead of an I or something and hit enter and it takes me to some phishing site

106
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,360
which is cloned whatever website they know I'm trying to go to and

107
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,040
So, you know call me a little bit

108
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,440
of a worry wart in that way, but

109
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,960
It makes sure that I don't mess up and do something that I'm gonna regret because those people

110
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,840
They'll they'll steal your whole life away if you if you let them so I

111
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,800
think the general concept of

112
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:30,520
When you type something in a URL bar, it gives you suggestions. I think it's a fantastic idea. I wish other browsers

113
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,520
Brave or duck duck go or whatever

114
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,320
Firefox I wish they would all do it but that they would suggest

115
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,160
Meaningful sites I can see that Google does have an incentive. They don't just make

116
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,480
Features, especially ones as low-key as this

117
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:57,360
For free. So of course, they're gonna use it for some sort of advertising or we're pushing certain types of products over others

118
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,480
Which is gonna be annoying but the base idea is there and I think that everything should adopt it

119
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,480
I think it's a great way to solve a problem and put my mind at ease. I don't know if I'll

120
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,080
Trust it to start but maybe it'll get me over my habit of having to

121
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
search for sites and

122
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,280
Go based off a search engine. So we'll find out on that

123
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,960
Augmented reality it's it's a specific type of virtual

124
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,280
reality

125
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,600
That I enjoy more than virtual reality

126
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,680
so

127
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:36,880
You'll find people who are in the augmented reality camp and really want to be in that space and then you'll find the people

128
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,640
In the virtual reality camp and really want to be in that space now, of course

129
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,160
People can be interested in both

130
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,880
However, you usually have people who are weighted more towards one than the other for me. It's augmented reality

131
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:57,240
I really love the idea of augmented reality having the space around you and being in the real world and

132
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,560
augmenting it

133
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,520
That's awesome. That's something straight out of you know, I robot or or

134
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:10,320
You know, I robot or or minority report or whatever, you know, all those those cool sci-fi movies

135
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,960
so being able to

136
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:17,560
put a video and pen it to a wall and just like walk around and have it stuck to that wall where you left it and

137
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,840
And place things and pin them to the world is I don't know. It's just kind of a really neat

138
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,480
Concept to me virtual reality

139
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,960
kind of

140
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,800
Absorbs your senses and that you put you into a 3d world. So it it's

141
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,960
Fun and and all that but it really isn't something you could do for all day

142
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,920
I can see augmented reality in some ways

143
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:47,400
Be an all-day thing for work or whatever something that just because you're still part of the real world

144
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
you're just putting things around in it and

145
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:57,560
That I think is where the appeal is for me now the one problem I have with augmented reality is a lot of the

146
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:03,320
Game developers. It's not a problem with augmented reality per se is problem with the ideas people are having

147
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,680
a lot of the time people are having these ideas of board games you can put a

148
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:15,960
Board game on a table and you have these 3d characters and special effects and meteorites and dragons come down and moving

149
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,160
And that's kind of cool for a movie aspect

150
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:26,160
But what about games that involve moving around and puzzle solving and you know different parts?

151
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:32,760
It's not just stuck on a table and a lot of other augmented reality is kind of I don't know what to call it

152
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,960
It's the

153
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,640
Nintendo DS effect where they give you those cards and then you can look at them and a little character pops out

154
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,080
It's the same kind of concept as the board game

155
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,720
now that being said

156
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:50,960
There's this cool project. Somebody's messing around with and I really like it. It's basically portals. It's there's not a whole lot to it

157
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,960
you've got two portals and

158
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,200
You can smack the objects around between these portals

159
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,480
So you pass it in that portal will come out the other one on the other side and you can pass it through

160
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,680
and that's a really neat concept because now you're getting out of the space of

161
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,100
Tabletop things and you're getting into the space of

162
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:15,480
Objects moving within your space and you're interacting with them with your hand in this scenario

163
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,800
so, of course you have the challenge of not being able to feel the object so

164
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,440
It's it's a little difficult to perceive

165
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,400
but

166
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,520
This guy seems to be handling it just fine. He's I

167
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:36,800
Think it does a palm check from the looks of it kind of like a like a flat plane is

168
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:43,200
Where the hand is and that's what he's kind of using to bash this stuff around. It's really cool. So

169
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,720
This is the kind of stuff. I'm hoping to see more in the future. I want to see more games like this imagine

170
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,160
some

171
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,160
Escape-room kind of scenario where you can multiplayer with a friend

172
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:59,920
Things could be hidden in the room where you can find levers and pull them and things other things change in the room

173
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:07,840
It's just I think there's a lot of cool things we can do with this kind of concept and get out of the gimmick

174
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,400
realm of augmented reality

175
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,320
So if you guys have any suggestions or concepts

176
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,280
Augmented reality. Let me know if you like virtual reality more than

177
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,760
Augmented reality. I'd love to hear your arguments for it. I I think that you know, there's a lot of

178
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,040
Things in that space you can think of all the games that are out there. You can think of

179
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,000
Zuckerberg land, whatever it's called. I can't remember

180
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,440
metaverse so

181
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:45,080
There's a lot of stuff out there for VR. So it does have substance. I'd like to see a lot more kind of go into

182
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,760
augmented reality and I have another

183
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,520
time I have another thing in this topic of augmented reality and

184
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,960
It's this article here. Let's see. Let me open it up

185
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,360
It's

186
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,760
Mainly just text. I want to see if I can

187
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
get a picture of

188
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:13,200
The person using it. So this this is on the verge this lady is

189
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,200
Using this augmented reality set from what it looks like. It's a keyboard

190
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,480
Looks like it has a trackpad and it's connected to these glasses

191
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,720
Now this isn't anything new. There's actually quite a few products out there for

192
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:34,480
Glasses that connect to some kind of device whether it's your phone or a laptop and project screens and all that

193
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,800
But in this one, it's neat because it looks like it doesn't have a screen at all

194
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:45,680
It's just some glasses. I guess this is the protective case that you could put the glasses underneath you can close this perhaps

195
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,440
keyboard and trackpad and

196
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,160
Oh this this camera must be for maybe gestures or something like that

197
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,800
But I I haven't fully

198
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,760
Fully figured out everything that's going on in this thing. There's a second person using it and I guess this is

199
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,480
either a projected example or it's

200
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:13,880
Potentially a mock-up of what this dude sees it's the same device. I

201
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,480
Think this might be a mock-up of what they're seeing

202
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,360
but

203
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,360
Like this is this is really cool

204
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:26,040
This is you don't have a screen that you're kind of staring at you can put it at a nice viewing distance

205
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:32,080
If you're like me and you have eyes with two different that require two vastly different lenses

206
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,920
for glasses

207
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:40,160
This is fantastic because you can get the effect of having things more clear

208
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:46,840
Through this digital medium and what I mean by that is for example, it's hard to explain

209
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:52,040
I have so in my right eye. It's it's much more blurry than my left eye

210
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:57,160
My left eye is actually pretty good. My right eye is incredibly blurry is accident when I was a child

211
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,960
there's a

212
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:04,800
When I look at the viewfinder in a camera with my blurry eye, it's clear as day

213
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,800
It's I can see everything around it's like wearing

214
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,440
superglasses, so

215
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,960
Augmented reality I feel like has a fantastic

216
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,080
Benefit of being able to make those screens

217
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:25,720
clearer because you'll be able to adjust the kind of the lenses and their focus and all that sort of stuff

218
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:31,320
So it's just I don't know it's gonna be wonderful. I can't wait for it. I really like to try this

219
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,240
This device out. I'm sure it's gonna be super expensive

220
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,560
So I'm probably not gonna try anytime soon, but the moment this sort of device becomes more commercial and consumer grade

221
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,840
It's probably gonna be something that I mess with even if it's just a little bit of a

222
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,800
It's probably gonna be something that I mess with even if I look like a dork with the glasses on I mean, whatever

223
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,000
It doesn't matter, especially if I'm in the privacy of my own home. I mean

224
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:01,200
What does matter so super excited about augmented reality super excited about seeing these things coming to augmented reality?

225
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:16,720
The concepts and and all of these new gadgets. I don't know. I'm just really hyped about this



1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Unfinished projects. This is something that plagues developers of all kinds.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
As a game developer, I know it plagues me constantly to never finish projects.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And I've seen a lot of articles. There's articles in basically every single development news, blog, site in existence.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Who is either talking about the graveyard of all of the projects that they've never finished.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Or they talk about ideas on how to actually finish projects.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Now, I do feel somewhat incomplete when I have this big idea for a project.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Big, grandiose idea. Got all the bells and whistles.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:03,000
One of the problems I have is that I maybe replay the entire concept in my head so many times that it gets boring and I move on to something else.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But, you know, that's the way it works.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Now, some advice on dead projects.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
There will always be another project.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And we have all come up with ideas that we gave up on that somebody else wound up finishing and making tons of money on.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's happened to all of us.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
At least three or four of my projects, somebody went out and made millions of dollars doing the same thing, except they've completed it.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So it has extra things that I didn't think of.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So, generally, I think it's good to first calm down and relax.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Life is long. Life is short.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
There are many more important things than finishing projects.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Your kids are having kids at all.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's a fantastic thing that I know you think is probably a cliché if you don't have kids to think that everybody, ugh, everyone says that and then they have kids and all of a sudden they're all about kids.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Now, it does give a completely new meaning to life and a whole new purpose just by its very nature.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But I'm not here to talk about that.

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm just here to say that's one of many things.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It could be the studies you have with friends or the groups that you go and meet up on or the random projects you do with groups or your work or your church or there's so many things in the list of more important things than finishing your project.

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Don't let finishing your projects or dead projects or graveyards of projects make you feel bad.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I don't feel bad for all the projects that I have not completed and it is a lot.

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
My GitHub is enormous.

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I have to scroll a long way to look through and find an old project.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And that's, you know, one of the best things that come out of not completing projects and just doing the parts you like and then going on to something else or any of that is that it's iteration.

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You learn from it.

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Each time you do that, you make some progress on either a new idea or you become a better developer just in general, whether you learn some art, learn some programming or what have you.

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Now, I know that I've learned tons of stuff as far as networking and art and tools for art and game engines and code and code paradigms, good structure and everything else, because sometimes my projects are just about doing a project that fits a code standard that I've never done before.

33
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And those dead projects all add up, you know, in your mind and it gives you that history that you can then use later.

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So all the articles that I see a lot of people either complaining about how it makes them feel absolutely terrible, they get burned out and they take breaks.

35
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I've talked about this before.

36
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I've never been burnt out in the past 15 years and I don't see myself getting burned out on programming in the next 15 either or until I die.

37
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'll probably die with my hands on the keyboard typing out some line of code or something.

38
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So don't let it get to you.

39
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And that's just something that I think has been creeping up a lot.

40
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's crept up a lot over the past couple of years, since 2020, because a lot of people have been trying to make some kind of projects.

41
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Now, there's a lot of programmers out there and there's a lot of people making projects.

42
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You can't expect to be the guy.

43
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That's what I tell my friends and some of my family who feel depressed whenever they didn't complete something or they can't stick to a regiment is you don't need to be the guy.

44
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The guy is out there in the world and he'll do great things, but the grass is always greener.

45
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That person wishes they're you and you wish you were them.

46
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's just how it goes.

47
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Just enjoy the process of coming up with ideas, writing them down, drawing them, sketching them, making flow charts, coding up stuff, trying out new engines and new languages.

48
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Just enjoy it.

49
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Would you rather be sitting around watching TV all day?

50
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm sure that a lot of people who listen to podcasts like this are thinking about something or they want to work on something or they have it in the background.

51
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's just another form of entertainment, I think is what I'm getting at.

52
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
When you do these projects, it's entertaining and that's what it should be.

53
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's the whole point of doing them is to have fun.

54
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So don't have high expectations for your project.

55
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Just do the things that you love about it.

56
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
If you're tired of it, move on.

57
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's that simple.

58
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Honestly, we're pretty good at that because we have graveyards of projects, now don't we?

59
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So three quick articles that I came across today.

60
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
One is Twitter Blue subscribers now can upload two-hour videos.

61
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I think it was an hour before.

62
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
If you're into Twitter Blue, then you get longer videos.

63
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's good to see that they're adding features to Twitter Blue.

64
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I know it was a big old stink.

65
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I have no opinion.

66
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I don't like to make everything a political argument.

67
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I think some things just let sleeping dogs lie.

68
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So I think Twitter Blue is a good example of that in principle because it attempts to move away from advertising and collecting your data,

69
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
even though they continue to do that.

70
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I think if Twitter was able to get the subscriber backing that they needed, they would probably phase out ads just as a feature.

71
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
If you do Twitter Blue, it'll completely remove ads.

72
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So I think that adding these new features to Twitter Blue is great.

73
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's great to see that they're adding them.

74
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I mean, this isn't a huge one.

75
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's just extending the frame, the time length of videos, but not bad.

76
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Hopefully we'll see some more, and I'm interested to see how that goes.

77
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So the next one is the Steam Deck.

78
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The Steam Deck has a full HD plus display upgrade.

79
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And here's the article on that from XDA Developers.

80
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's $100, and it upgrades to 1920 by 1200 for the resolution from what it currently is, which is 1280 by 800.

81
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm assuming the HD plus, the plus is the added pixels on the vertical because it's not 1920 by 1080.

82
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Now I checked through this ad, and I didn't see anything about how it affects your battery life.

83
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I assume if you're going to be driving a higher density display, you're probably going to wind up using more battery.

84
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:20,000
For me personally, I wouldn't pay $100 for this upgrade because I hold the Steam Deck at a comfortable distance from my face,

85
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and I can play it. It feels good. Everything looks fine.

86
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The size of the screen, it plays well with the resolution.

87
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:36,000
If you're one of those people who are more affected by seeing the pixels and the density, maybe this upgrade is for you.

88
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I don't know. It's definitely cool.

89
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
If somebody does this upgrade, please let me know how you feel about it.

90
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Does it drain your battery?

91
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I do want to see more Steam Deck mods because I love the Steam Deck.

92
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I have a Steam Deck. I bought my wife the Steam Deck. It's a great device.

93
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I know there's new alternatives now with Asus, I think.

94
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But the Steam Deck is nice because it's sold a lot, and it's a constant, kind of a fixed type of device right now.

95
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So the dimensions and all of that, they're uniform, and so a lot of cool gadgets and add-ons and those sorts of things can be added for it.

96
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So yeah, check this out if it's something that interests you.

97
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Steam Deck Full HD Plus Display.

98
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
$100 doesn't seem that bad for a display upgrade.

99
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I don't know. I don't upgrade displays.

100
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's cheaper than a monitor, a 1080p monitor, so maybe that's worth it.

101
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And then the third quick story that I have is Stability AI releases Stable Studio, an open-source future of Dream Studio.

102
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So this is an image generation AI. I haven't used it but maybe once or twice just to play around with it.

103
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You go to the site, you have some tokens. It's kind of like the Bing.

104
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I think Bing uses DALI from OpenAI where you get some tokens and you can generate some pictures based on using those tokens,

105
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and then you buy more tokens. For Bing, you search more and get tokens that you can use.

106
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
These are coins. I don't know what Bing calls them.

107
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Stability AI has released a GitHub repository. Let me see if I can load it up here.

108
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Here's their landing page about it.

109
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
They have Stable Studio. If I click on this, it'll take me to GitHub.

110
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Now, this was exciting at first because I thought, oh, we're getting closer to more local AI, which is what I want.

111
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I want private local AI. I don't want cloud-based AI. I think that's just asking for disaster.

112
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I want local private AI. I want to be able to send my local private AI to go on the Internet to do things for me anonymously

113
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:12,000
so I don't have to go on there and drudge through the madness that is coming from all the AI stuff that's about to spawn on the Internet

114
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
or already has spawned on the Internet.

115
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Now, this is not a step closer to private local AI. It's nice that they made it.

116
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It seems like it's just taking their web studio app, web app, and allowing you to run it locally.

117
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Now, it does not run the image generation locally. You are required to use your API key for Stability AI.

118
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So it's basically saying instead of using their website and costing them money to host the website, you host it and still pay for the API key.

119
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And that makes sense. Everybody's got to make their money, right? It's a capitalist society. No problem with that.

120
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I want these guys to continue. I want them to thrive. I want them to explore and go to the new frontier of artificial intelligence.

121
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But I'm more interested in private local personal AI.

122
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I know that, man, it's probably a pipe dream because you imagine that your phone is your private local device, but it's not.

123
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You have Apple watching everything you do, knowing everything you're doing, how fast you're going, obviously.

124
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:38,000
They do the emergency alerts and hiding behind the auspices of protecting lives is a great way to spy on people, honestly.

125
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
They think they've got it. They've got the formula right there for that.

126
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But I really want to see more private, just locally, AI that's mine.

127
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And I doubt we're going to see it. We're going to see companies that come up with private local AI devices.

128
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And maybe there will be some that are genuine, but the biggest hitters, like I bet you this will be something Google and Microsoft and Apple and everybody else does,

129
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:18,000
they'll probably tie it to the phone. And it's not private and local if it uses their web services or tracks what you do or any of that sort of nonsense.

130
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I do. I'm a hopeful person. I'm mostly an optimist for all of life, everything. I try to see the silver lining, everything.

131
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And I see wonderful things with private, locally AI that I can tell to do things or come up with ideas or go on the Internet and do things for me, all that sort of stuff.

132
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I think that's a wonderful thing. And capturing memories, like, you know, we use phones to take pictures and videos.

133
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:56,000
But if I can store them in AI and AI can replay them and then when I'm dead, potentially be something that I can, my kids can review or they could just throw it away.

134
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It doesn't matter to me. However, they want to grieve. That's fine with me. But I just think it would be really cool to do more local private AI.

135
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And unfortunately, this sounded like it was, but really it's just, I think it's just the web. I actually tested it.

136
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You use Yarn, fire up the web API, and then it just does API requests to their service.

137
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So I think you might be able to hook it up to something like, it definitely isn't going to be a one-click solution right now.

138
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'll have to look more into it and let you know what I find.

139
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:43,000
But maybe that's the future, is it takes this web API front end that, or this web front end that allows you to query an AI and then you can change the back end.

140
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
That would be pretty dope. But I don't know if that's what it is. We shall find out.

141
00:14:49,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So that's three kind of quick stories. And yeah, let me know what you think.



1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
Google is back at its shenanigans

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,200
so

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,540
There's there's been an

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:15,320
There's been an announcement that Google is gonna be turning off third-party cookies for 1% of Chrome users

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,320
by

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,840
q1 of 2024 so

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:28,640
Anybody may be thinking about this and say well, that's awesome. You know cookies are annoying they track us they they

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,640
they're a way of

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,840
Saving little bits of data and seeing us cross sites and all this other sort of

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,560
Craziness, especially when you start embedding say Google logins or Facebook logins or whatever

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,760
integrations with third-party stuff then they can start tracking the people who come to your

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,240
Website or your web application or your mobile app or any of those?

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,840
so

14
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,040
Yeah, at first it sounds this is fantastic now

15
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:07,160
Those of us who think about security and use browsers that are more secure

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,240
All right

17
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,160
You know, you know like Firefox or brave

18
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:20,240
We use those browsers because they automatically block cookies or you may have privacy badger or you may have you know

19
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,360
Any of the various other?

20
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,000
plugins to block cookies and and stop trackers and

21
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,120
You may use duck calm or duck duck go as it's called

22
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:37,240
The funny news for a funny funny story about that Google actually

23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,560
Registered duck calm a while back a long time ago

24
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:49,680
To prevent duck duck go from registering it. I think there was a whole lawsuit about it, but duck duck go now finally owns

25
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,840
Duck calm which is awesome

26
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,360
It's good that they're not into that weird battle and it's a lot easier to type a duck calm than it is to type duck

27
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,400
duck go

28
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,400
calm or whatever so

29
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:09,560
Anyways that aside you may be thinking this is a great idea Google. That sounds great now

30
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,040
What a lot of people point out is that Google as we've stated earlier is

31
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,720
Is is in the practice of favoring

32
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,360
Themselves and their third-party partners and people who use their services and ultimately make the money

33
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,200
Obviously, they're a corporation. They want to make money. They're gonna do that

34
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,800
So in general the background of this is Google has been talking about

35
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:44,240
Getting rid of these is the third-party cookies notice. It's called third-party cookies since

36
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,560
2020 and in three years, that's not happened at all

37
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,520
Now what Google is announcing is that in Chrome?

38
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,200
Build 115 which is gonna be released in July. It's a couple months from now

39
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,960
It will include the privacy sandbox feature flag and you can go into the the privacy sandbox

40
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:13,760
The privacy sandbox so you can go into the settings the flags of Chrome and you can turn it on at that point

41
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,320
to block those cookies

42
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,640
the goal is that this is a temporary thing for people and and

43
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,240
They're just gonna have it integrated normally

44
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,240
So it's gonna be a good benefit to stop tracking but it's gonna be a bad thing because

45
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:37,160
They don't mention anything about their cookies. And of course, it's their browser. They can see every site you go to

46
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,000
So it seems a little unfair to block everybody else, but you're special

47
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,680
like I think

48
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,680
That just one ups the browser wars, which is which is probably one of the reasons

49
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:58,120
Microsoft has hit so hard with being and being chat recently and you know, it's been pretty effective from what I can tell so

50
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,520
Now in order for Microsoft to do the tracking that they want or need

51
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,040
They have to have people in their browser

52
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,520
So just do yourself a favor get out of the browser wars of the big companies get off of Chrome

53
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,840
You don't have to get off of chromium

54
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,080
Basically every browser but Firefox is chromium

55
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,080
You can you can have multiple browsers installed

56
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:26,440
I have brave is my default browser right now and I have Firefox which is my default browser on Linux

57
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,280
and so I interchange them just it's

58
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,200
It's more convenient and I don't know. I don't know why it's convenient

59
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,120
It's convenient on Linux because it usually comes with Firefox built-in. I guess maybe that's why

60
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,440
but use browsers like those which already do the blocking and they're not biased because

61
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:54,440
They block Google and they block Microsoft just the same and maybe they'll block Google harder than the rest and that's okay with me

62
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,480
Because Google is a tyrant with tracking so

63
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,800
Yeah, swap your browsers. This is a cool story

64
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,040
but

65
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,920
Really? It seems like it's just a way for for Google to take more control

66
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:15,520
From other people who aren't Google and it's maybe a way for them to bully people into using their services

67
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,280
Like AdSense and and all those other

68
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,440
their web tracking stuff add words

69
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,040
Webmaster tools. It's probably a way of bullying people to stick with them, which is unfortunate

70
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,520
So just go to another browser ignore Google and the rest

71
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,840
So that's my advice on that piece of news good to see

72
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,640
but plenty of other browsers have already beaten you to it and plenty of plugins have to so

73
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:46,480
It's good for the less technical people. I guess as you may know, I am a programmer

74
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:54,160
I am a programmer by day and by night and by weekend and always I'm always a programmer

75
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,920
but at night I moonlight as a podcaster, so

76
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,080
Now we're gonna talk a little bit about code

77
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,600
.NET 8 is

78
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,240
Being released if you haven't heard this is all all the.NET people rejoice. I

79
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,520
I find that this one is mostly just kind of like build stuff

80
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,560
Which is cool better build stuff easier build stuff

81
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:26,440
The that's that's always nice when you focus on that and you don't add ridiculous parts to your languages like C sharp

82
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,960
I love C sharp, but man, do they add some confusing things in there?

83
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,920
Nullables are a really cool concept

84
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,600
for example and

85
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,240
They're good. If you start your project with nulls or nullables or non nullables

86
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
but

87
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,480
But if you add it in the middle of a project it

88
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:55,200
Really just wrecks things and I've had people add them into the middle of projects before and it becomes madness

89
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,200
So some of the features are cool

90
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,600
just in isolation, I suppose so

91
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,920
This one seems to be mostly

92
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:10,280
This is from from somebody on dev.to which I think is a dev blogging site

93
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,680
So there's MS build output upgrade

94
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,880
there is

95
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,400
Tweaks to the output path. There's new git stuff

96
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,640
Package signing for Linux

97
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Dependencies

98
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,320
Auditing I

99
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,560
Don't know what this is handle vulnerable packages like a pro

100
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,400
Oh, I guess this is just old packages or haven't been updated in a while

101
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,480
Embrace the power of you

102
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,960
Oh

103
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,960
Uta span formatable. So utf-8 has been in C sharp for a long time

104
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,100
So you should have been embracing the power of utf-8 all along by the way

105
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,320
I embrace the power of utf-8 in my C code

106
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,760
Which I have to write functions for utf-8 myself

107
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:10,480
So you should be using it in a language that fully supports it, but it looks like it's getting some added

108
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,480
niceties

109
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,320
Which is always nice to say the least

110
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,080
Let's see ahead of time

111
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,840
compiler so

112
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,440
Did you know done a pre before console?

113
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:33,080
Ahead of time now one of the problems like with iOS is it does not allow for support of just-in-time

114
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:39,120
Compilers it doesn't like they don't want you adding scripting stuff in there or anything like that

115
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,720
You got to have pre compiled ahead of time all the way and this is one of the reasons unity had to swap

116
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,160
And create IL to CPP to convert everything

117
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:58,160
From C sharp IL to C++ now there's a lot. There's a misconception that people have that that just magically makes your code faster

118
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,080
It does not I don't know if you've seen the generated C++ code it is

119
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:09,160
Madness now it may be faster in certain algorithms because the compiler that compiles the C++

120
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,600
I don't know exactly which one they use it's probably clang

121
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,340
can pick up on code patterns and optimize a lot of the code in that way, so

122
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:24,740
There are areas where it can get faster, but in general it might actually be slower than the standard C sharp stuff

123
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,320
So anyways, that's that's a whole tangent on just-in-time compiler. Sorry about that

124
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,820
we've got some JSON deserialized stuff more JSON stuff and

125
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,580
some logging updates, so this is kind of I think a a

126
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,460
Quality of life upgrade not not a whole bunch of new

127
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:47,800
New system libraries or any of that. I don't think it really needs a whole lot more

128
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:54,380
There's quite a bit in C sharp to take advantage of you can't really use everything in one project. There's so much stuff so

129
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:00,340
Those of you who like net are probably gonna like this. I will put the

130
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:05,020
Put the link to this article. I'm sure you can find any there's tons of dotnet eight

131
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:12,660
Things out there. I just thought this was nice because is a kind of a little breakdown with with animated images

132
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,060
so

133
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:21,300
Yeah, I'll put this on Twitter. I'll put this in the description for you to check it out, but dotnet eight is here

134
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,540
Okay, so that's gonna do it for today. Hopefully

135
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,340
Hopefully that was informative

136
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:33,140
Let me know if you have any ideas for things you want me to talk about or maybe some cool stories in

137
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:41,600
Tech or programming or game development or just any of those kind of fields that you think I'd like just cinema cinema my way

138
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
I love going over this kind of stuff, so

139
00:10:43,600 --> 00:11:10,260
Thanks for watching and until next time bye for now
