00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
All right, welcome back. Today I learned that Valve is getting sued for the Steam Deck.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:13,880
Other than that, I wanted to talk about private chats, some AI stuff, some local AI stuff,

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:21,800
clean code and GitHub and that sort of stuff. So I guess the very first thing straight off,

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:29,000
I just learned about it a minute ago, was that Valve is now getting sued or, I don't

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,040
know, a lawsuit has been filed for the Steam Deck and you may be wondering what on earth

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:46,680
could it be over? And that's exactly what I was thinking. And it's for a patent. No,

7
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,880
Steam didn't, or Valve didn't just blatantly copy a patent or steal it or anything like

8
00:00:52,880 --> 00:01:00,120
that. It's just that Valve is falling prey to a patent troll. If you don't know what

9
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:07,680
a patent troll is, it's basically a consortium of people who buy up software and hardware

10
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,440
patents and they produce nothing themselves. They just sit around on their thumbs doing

11
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:19,040
nothing other than they had some money to buy some ideas from people that were probably

12
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,440
smarter than they are. Or maybe they're not as smart as they are because they're the ones

13
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,560
who bought all the patents. And essentially what they do is they sue everybody and force

14
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:40,840
them to pay them royalties. And the patent that I didn't even know was a patent is haptics.

15
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:48,360
So the little vibrations that you feel on basically everything from phones to controllers,

16
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:54,520
those apparently are patented by some dudes somewhere who had enough money to buy the

17
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:00,560
patent and then do nothing other than sit there and reap rewards of everyone else's

18
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:08,200
success. I'm a little annoyed at it. I've always disliked patent trolls. I think the

19
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:15,600
way that I put it on Twitter was the idea guys that do nothing and sit in mom's basement

20
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:22,360
and perhaps all the other guys went off and they made something successful, but this dude

21
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:29,960
had equity so he's just going to reap the rewards for existing. It's very annoying.

22
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:38,160
It sucks. I think it stifles innovation. That's basically my take on that. In fact, here we

23
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:48,240
can take a look at it. Here I have the link. This is from The Verge. You can see, well,

24
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:54,360
it's night for you, morning, or it's night for me, morning for you. This just happened

25
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:02,760
a minute ago. The company is called Immersion Corporation. And that right there, that name

26
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:09,120
kind of gives away the game. Immersion Corporation sounds like we bought up all the patents for

27
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,240
haptics that we could find on the internet and are going to sue everybody into the ground

28
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:19,880
and otherwise force them to pay us royalties and also give us a big chunk of change right

29
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:28,040
at the beginning underneath the table. Otherwise, we're going to sue you. It's really annoying.

30
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:34,280
Immersion Corporation, I even looked up who the heck is Immersion Corporation and it's

31
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:42,440
just a bunch of flashy videos of phones and stuff. They produce nothing as far as I can

32
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:53,360
tell on here. Just some company that I would dare say stole patents with money. Stole it

33
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:00,480
with money. Anyways, that's really annoying. It happens to the best of us. Valve is probably

34
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,640
just going to pay them the money under the table or out of the court to skip the lawsuit

35
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:18,960
and just pay them royalties. I'm a little miffed about that. I don't know if other people

36
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,920
have the same feelings about it. I'm sure a lot of people are ambivalent to it. It just

37
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:35,040
annoys me, the guys who do nothing and prey on others. It's a little... Anyways, well

38
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,360
that's that. One of the things I wanted to go over today other than that, since that

39
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:50,240
popped out of nowhere, was private messages. Twitter recently released their secure messages.

40
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:58,480
I think that they were in talks with the guys from Signal and they produced their untrustable

41
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:08,560
or the don't trust it yet messaging system. That's just something that they mentioned.

42
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:16,880
Don't trust it yet, give it a try though. Now, I'm not a Twitter hater or I don't know

43
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:27,120
whatever bandwagon people have about all that. What I like is that there are private messages

44
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,200
at all, secure messages at all. A company like this does not have to add secure messaging

45
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:42,200
to their app. They could just go on being completely insecure. That's not great for

46
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:48,520
the people. It doesn't actually... Look, nobody is saying, I'm going to make a Twitter account

47
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:55,520
now because the messages are secure. I'm pretty sure most people don't even use Twitter direct

48
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,880
messages. I've never even used it. I'd like to use it now that it's secure. I'd like to

49
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:07,440
see what it looks like. Is there a little padlock or something? I'm curious. Not something

50
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:16,320
I'm going to jump ship from. I use Signal for all of my private messages with my family,

51
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:22,160
both my immediate family, like my wife and I almost exclusively talk on Signal. I have

52
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,560
a family group chat on there where I talk with all of my family. Sure, it does use up

53
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,680
a lot of your storage because it's locally stored. That's the whole point is that it's

54
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:39,160
not stored on somebody's server somewhere. I'm probably not going to be jumping ship

55
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:47,720
off of Signal anytime soon, maybe even ever. It all depends on where they take it. Companies

56
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:54,080
like this can promise the world and then swap out from underneath you to doing something

57
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:01,800
else. I think, though I like Telegram, I don't actively use it because it's hosted on somebody's

58
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:09,560
server somewhere and they kind of just promise security and safety and that sort of stuff.

59
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,440
You can trust it. Lots of people do. They could be telling the truth. I do like the

60
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:20,440
idea of it all being locally on my device, even if it is a little bit of an annoyance,

61
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,440
taking up the space and then having to make backups and then not being able to transfer

62
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:30,040
it to another device like my desktop. There are annoyances for it not being a server.

63
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:35,960
I would host my own or make my own little messaging app for my family. I've done Diffie

64
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,440
Hellman encryption, the whole process of updating the key on every message and all that sort

65
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:46,800
of stuff for fun. Making a whole app that my whole family is willing to jump on and

66
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,720
even friends and new friends are willing to jump on, it's not going to happen. It's a

67
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:57,560
lot easier for me to just use Signal. Moral of the story here is that I love that Twitter

68
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:07,600
is moving towards these secure DMs. Everything should be secure DMs. It's just out of respect

69
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:13,240
for the people who use your platform. All in all, they are trying to advertise to you

70
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,560
and you never know what's going on in the background. I think these are also on the

71
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:25,120
server kind of obviously. Same difference between the Twitter DMs and what's the one

72
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:36,320
Facebook owns, that one, and Telegram and all of those. So stick with Signal because

73
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,680
it's local. Signal does store it on a server until it gets delivered and confirm that it's

74
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:49,920
delivered. So there is that little middleman aspect there. It's kind of like a cousin of

75
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,280
mine. He said he loves Apple because of their secure messages. And then I asked him, I was

76
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:02,880
like, well, you know, they do have secure messages, but if you buy a new phone, you

77
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,280
get all of your old messages out of nowhere. That means that all the messages were stored

78
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:13,480
on some server and they can be decrypted on a different device. Just the different device

79
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,480
that exists, that just so happens to exist with your phone number. I don't know if it's

80
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,720
locked to your phone number or anything. So you can get all of your old messages and they

81
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,640
all get decrypted. So that right there just means that it exists somewhere and it can

82
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:34,240
be decrypted. So security is in the promise, I suppose, on that. But yeah, that was my

83
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:40,960
thoughts on Twitter secure DMs. If anyone exists out there that wants to try it out,

84
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:51,800
send me a message on Twitter. And yeah, thank you. So that's basically it for the secure

85
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:59,880
messaging stuff. I don't want to go on too much of a rant for that. Now, I did want to

86
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:07,240
talk about some AI stuff. As you know, I deal with AI stuff for fun. I like making random

87
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:14,280
prompts, that sort of stuff. Nothing serious. So I am not up to date on all the crazy newness

88
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,280
and all the things people are doing now and the tricks and that sort of stuff. So I just

89
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:27,280
learned about GPT4ALL today, which was pretty neat. If you haven't heard of it, it's basically

90
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:35,280
a local instance of these different models that you can run locally on your computer

91
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:44,400
without internet. And depending on your computer's processing power, it'll be slower or faster.

92
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:51,760
And you don't need a GPU to run it. I think that's because most of the training happens

93
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:58,280
through GPUs. But this is not training it. I think there is a way to train your own stuff,

94
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,760
which would be pretty cool. You'd take all the documents you've ever written or maybe

95
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,560
all the transcripts of all your videos or something like that and train the model on

96
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:14,040
it to be kind of like a mini-you, which would be kind of neat to see. But I like it just

97
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:21,600
for its local instance. So I wanted to point that out. I wanted to show which model I'm

98
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:29,720
using because the website itself says that this is the good model. So let's see if I

99
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:42,720
can zoom in. Oh, I can't zoom in. It's GPT4ALL JV1.3 Groovy. And if you go to GPT4ALL, here

100
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:51,800
let's just grab this and stick it up here, on their website they just boast about its

101
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:57,520
features. If you can't find the model you want, they do have this little drop-down that

102
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,000
tells you about the different models. So the one that's already selected is the one that

103
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,560
I downloaded. For me it was the second from the top, but I'm sure those shift around.

104
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:17,960
And it's the current best commercially licensable model based on GPT-J. And commercially licensable,

105
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:25,420
the reason that there is a distinction on these is that you can actually run a server

106
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:31,960
with this local instance. And you can run Python scripts to query against it and act

107
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:39,200
as like a client. And you can serve up servers and like make money using it and all that

108
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,720
sort of stuff. However, these models are licensed. Somebody did all the effort in training them.

109
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,160
So this particular one you can pay somebody, I guess, to use it if you want to use it commercially.

110
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:59,380
There are other ones like this Snoozy one, current best non-commercial commercially licensable

111
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:06,600
model. And the reason for that is that this is based on Llama13b, which is I think the

112
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:15,400
Facebook leaked stuff. So that's why you can't be like, yo, Facebook, I'm going to use that

113
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:20,360
thing that got leaked from your company. Can I give you a couple bucks? So obviously you

114
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,400
can't do that. But yeah, go give this a try. I was playing around with it on my laptop,

115
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:32,560
which is a Linux laptop with an Intel 11th Gen Tiger Lake, I think. It's not, yeah, Tiger

116
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,040
Lake processor. And it was fast enough. It was pretty decent. It wasn't like incredibly

117
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,120
slow. You'll try some of these offline ones and they're super slow. It was decently fast.

118
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,920
I haven't tried it on this computer yet, this laptop, much more beefy 12th Gen Intel core

119
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:58,000
processor. So I would be surprised if this one wasn't even faster. So yeah, go give this

120
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,920
a shot and try out that model. It's the second from the top for me, like I said, just review

121
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:14,680
it on the website and pick the model that you find most interesting. Another thing that

122
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:22,440
I learned about today, like I said, I'm just passively an AI person, prompter, whatever.

123
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,840
I don't make images or anything. I just like to prompt it and see what kind of stuff it

124
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:33,800
comes up with and cross-reference it or cross-check it. I don't know, check its work and that

125
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:39,200
sort of stuff. I do like to generate very small scripts that I really am too lazy to

126
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:48,320
write. So an example of a script that I wrote that I modified, I asked the AI to write it

127
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,200
for me, was a Lua script that took in a text file and this text file had time marks and

128
00:14:54,200 --> 00:15:00,640
then text of what was being said at those time marks. And it converted it into an SRT

129
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:07,960
file, which is just a closed captioning kind of timing file that prints out the text that's

130
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:14,520
being said at that timestamp. So I just told it to write me that script and it busted one

131
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:19,800
out, had a couple of mistakes in it. It didn't check for blank lines and that sort of stuff

132
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:25,760
that I just quickly knocked it out and fixed it. And also added a little extra feature

133
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,360
so it would spit out an extra text file, which was just the raw text of what was said without

134
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:38,360
timestamps. So I do play around with these for all sorts of things, stories and code

135
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:45,760
and all that. But something I learned about today was super prompts, which is an awesome

136
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:52,480
name. I do love when names are nice, like, I don't know, fun, fun like this. Some names

137
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,880
can be really boring, like they're just named after people. Like some of these models like

138
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,640
Ada or DaVinci or whatever. Cool, you named it after a person. But super prompt, that's

139
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:12,000
awesome. I mean, super is used for a ton of things. Basically, you can probably be sued

140
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:19,280
by Nintendo by putting super in front of stuff. They've used it so much. But I don't know,

141
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:25,440
I like the title of it. So what I learned about the super prompt today is basically

142
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,880
you either set up a really big prompt, it's this huge prompt that uses almost all of your

143
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,880
tokens. And if you don't know what a token is, it's essentially you get 4096 tokens or

144
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:45,240
so depending on the service you use and what you pay for and all that. And each, about

145
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:51,120
a third of each word is a token. So just say like each word is a token. And it really depends.

146
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,840
It could be the characters if you're using UTF-8 or whatever, and you're using foreign

147
00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:00,400
characters it may be per character that's presented. But generally in English I think

148
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:08,360
what they stated is it's on average about 75% of a word. And you can have up to 4096

149
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:15,160
of these tokens. And then when you hit that limit it won't respond or it just doesn't

150
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:21,680
know what to do. Often it'll say too much text or whatever. The webpage or whatever.

151
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:27,800
Even the local ones do this. They'll say, I filed too long or something like that. But

152
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:36,400
you can either pre-prompt it with one gigantic prompt and have it try to say things it shouldn't

153
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,160
say. Some people try to make it say bad words or whatever. But others try to make it sound

154
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:50,360
even more human or like you're talking to some specific character in history and making

155
00:17:50,360 --> 00:18:00,440
it kind of reply as if it was that person. So the super prompt isn't always just the

156
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:07,160
one big prompt in the beginning. It's also you're able to do it by feeding it multiple

157
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:14,200
prompts over and over and kind of building out this super context I'll call it. I don't

158
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:22,320
think it's called super context but I'm going to call it super context. And what people do is they call it hypnosis.

159
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:30,680
They hypnotize the AI so to speak by repeating things they've previously said in varied ways

160
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:37,200
in order to kind of shepherd it into a certain direction. And that's just so that they can

161
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:45,040
hit the neurons that aren't often hit on the fringes of the, I don't know what to call

162
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:52,400
it, AI matrix mind. And then you can get some pretty cool responses. You can see kind of

163
00:18:52,400 --> 00:19:01,240
the depth of its understanding of things. So those are kind of fun. That's what I learned

164
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:07,920
about today, super prompting. So go try to super prompt. Maybe you've done it without

165
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:18,720
even noticing that you've done it. Here I've just for completeness I asked Bing what a

166
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:25,400
super prompt was. And this was his response. You can pause to see this. I guess if you're

167
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:34,000
doing an audio only podcast. It says the super prompt is a term used in the context of chat

168
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,640
GPT. I don't know if it's specific to chat GPT. I just know it's used commonly with chat

169
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,760
GPT and other similar language models. It refers to a prompt that is designed to generate

170
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,920
a more advanced and complex response from the model. Super prompts are used to train

171
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:54,520
the model and generate more sophisticated responses that are closer to human-like conversation.

172
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:00,280
They're usually more detailed and specific rather than prompts that can include multiple

173
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:09,160
parts or sub parts. And these prompts can get long, by the way. So I think somebody

174
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:15,520
recorded like, I don't know if it was 16 minutes or 16 hours for chat GPT to respond with one

175
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:25,200
of these super prompts. And it was pretty neat. So go try super prompts today.

176
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:31,280
So we're going to jump from AI. We're going to talk more about some programming stuff.

177
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,040
As you know, I'm a programmer. I love code. I code all the time. I code as a day job.

178
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,000
I love code so much that I make this podcast and I include code stuff because I just love

179
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,720
code. So.



1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
You may have noticed a huge trend in the last few years of people moving to clean code

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,960
I want to use quote clean code

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,720
or people moving towards

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,740
You know

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,920
craftsmanship

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,280
clean

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,400
architecture all the stuff all these buzzwords and

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:25,840
Clean code is basically like testable code test driven development for some people

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,840
Tiny functions

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,000
Making every making it so that your code doesn't need comments to explain itself anybody can read it

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:41,520
And I like to throw design patterns in there because it's not often said with clean code for some reason as far as I've seen

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,240
But there's some really good design patterns that help you create clean code. My favorite design pattern is

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,040
the visitor pattern and

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:57,280
Visitor pattern and that's basically where you can create a system that executes

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,720
some unknown

16
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,040
maybe

17
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,280
structured concept it's hard to explain and

18
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,600
You pass it a class or you pass it a function and that's the mechanic that it runs

19
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,120
The context that it runs within so in that way you can have this

20
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:22,080
Core system that does a specific thing and you can alter it by passing in a class with certain functions or functions

21
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,920
themselves to change the behavior while keeping that one particular

22
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:35,920
Piece of code. So I think an easy example would be like rather than using inheritance to say there's an animal and from the animal

23
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,640
there is or there's a being which

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,600
Animal derives from and then you have a dog and a cat and they both have speak and they do a different response

25
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,120
instead of having a hierarchy

26
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,200
you can have a flat class that is

27
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,880
Animal processor and then you pass in a dog which has a speak function you pass in a cat which has a speak function

28
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,280
And it does speak that way so you don't have to do inheritance in that way

29
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,440
Cats and dogs in this scenario don't have any relationship at all

30
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:10,320
They don't have to you can use an interface or you can pass them as a function the cat function that does

31
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:18,440
The cat speak function or whatever and so the class itself that's managing it just knows that it gets things that speak and

32
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,240
It runs the speak code on it. So

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,620
That's the visitor pattern. There's tons of patterns

34
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:32,480
Just look up the gang the gang of four book if you have the book you can just go to the very back

35
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,520
The very back of the book and it has a list of all the patterns, which is nice

36
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,040
But yes, I will say

37
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,840
All that being said do not

38
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,400
Do not

39
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,960
Vehemently abide by clean code. I'll tell you this now I

40
00:02:52,960 --> 00:03:02,040
Write test functions to test AI generated code, but I don't often write test functions for my own code in my own projects

41
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
I

42
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,280
Make small functions that do very specific things

43
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,640
which it would be nonsensical for me to test because

44
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,960
Especially when I'm working alone when I'm working with a team, it's a different story

45
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,160
But when I'm working alone, I don't need to over complicate it. I know when I write a function

46
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:27,000
I don't change it if I change it. I'm very specific on how I refactor it whether it gets all deleted and

47
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,120
Replaced with something else or something in that realm. So

48
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:39,160
All you clean coders out there. Congratulations for knowing what clean code is and clean architecture and design patterns and

49
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,560
Test driven development and all that sort of stuff

50
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,000
but

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,240
Life is life is simple. Take it take it easy. Don't be zealot about it and

52
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,600
One of the things that you'll find is

53
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,440
If you adhere too close to clean code and everything's interfaces and everything's abstract and everything's going everywhere

54
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,800
especially for

55
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
your own personal projects or

56
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,480
Projects you put up on github as libraries. You'll find that you wind up with

57
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,960
Unreadable code anyways, even though your whole goal was to make readable code you get way too many

58
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,280
Intertwined different things or disconnected things even worse

59
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,200
One of the things I just an aside

60
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,920
When I program in unity, I like to

61
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,200
Leverage unity so all of its signals all of its how it connects different objects

62
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:39,240
I like to leverage it because when another person who's using unity comes and they they want to work with me

63
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,240
or they they

64
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,920
Just see the code or see the project. They understand what's going on

65
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,200
They can find where things are and what things are doing

66
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,360
they don't have to go through and

67
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:56,480
Find the class and then go to its manager and then go to the then go to the facade which manages the managers

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,160
List which comes from a factory which comes from an abstract factory

69
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:07,160
They don't need to go through all that to figure out that the character can jump they can see just straight in the code

70
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,160
Exactly what it's doing

71
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,080
And I get trying to abstract a way to make everything interchangeable and all that

72
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,760
But I will argue

73
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,920
That as a huge proponent of clean code by the way

74
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,120
In a lot of scenarios when especially in working with teams

75
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,760
It is a major downside and I will argue that

76
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,360
It'll bloat your code and make it unreadable if you adhere to it too far

77
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,640
And it'll slow down your code because you've you've abstracted everything

78
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,600
Just off to oblivion so

79
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,120
What I like to do in my personal projects is I like to stick to flat

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
non-hierarchical

81
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,480
refactorable code the most important thing in my mind is

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,400
That I write code that is easy to refactor whether it's deleting whole functions and replacing them with another

83
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,000
Or I write code that is easy to refactor

84
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
whether it's deleting whole functions and replacing them with another or

85
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,720
just

86
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,720
changing out being able to

87
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,200
Delete maybe an entire set of files or change out the data structure

88
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,160
Easily, that's what I aim for is refactorable code because I refactor my code

89
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:26,760
Non-stop all the time over and over my game engine that I was I've written NC has been rewritten multiple times

90
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,960
I've converted it to C++ and converted back to C twice and

91
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,520
I've also

92
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,360
Refactored the entire math library and everything else. And so it's been it's like

93
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,520
What's that joke Theseus's ship?

94
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,800
I know that off the top of my head because

95
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,720
My wife has been making fun of this person who fixes her husband's shoes and not making fun of her

96
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,200
But making fun of the people comment on it because every comment is oh, it reminds me of Theseus ship

97
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,600
But that's kind of what my code is. Like everything's been replaced

98
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:02,200
It's it's not none of the code is the same from the original maybe except for some of my standard string

99
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,200
String functions and stuff like that

100
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:11,280
So that's my thoughts on the clean code try to do clean code, but don't don't stick to it too strictly

101
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,380
Now I I don't want to speak just to advanced programmers

102
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,480
to to more inexperienced programmers people who are just

103
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:29,320
Learning or learning the ropes or getting into things or you're an advanced programmer. You've done assembly coding, but you haven't done any web

104
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:35,040
One of the things that I've seen in repositories recently, which is why I want to talk about it is

105
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:43,280
you'll find API keys and other sensitive keys and that sort of stuff inside of public github repositories and

106
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,280
You know people can take those keys and wind up racking up a bill for you

107
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,960
in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if there's people who

108
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,040
crawl through the different projects looking for

109
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:00,240
Keywords for specific API's and see if they can't get a free key for a little bit and

110
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,320
And I've seen people ask about it, what do you do with you know these keys so

111
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,600
Especially in web or any kind of development. It doesn't have to be web. You could be deploying

112
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,600
Game server or anything like that. You don't put your keys anywhere in your code base at all

113
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:25,320
I if you need to regenerate keys because you forgot it or you've deleted something that you're keeping it

114
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,640
It is a secure place. You were keeping it in no big deal regenerate it

115
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,960
But

116
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,160
What you want to do is when you deploy?

117
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,280
your

118
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:41,480
Code your application your game server is that you want to push your key?

119
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,760
Through through and add it as the environment variables

120
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,120
Or add it as a file. That's inaccessible

121
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,720
That's kind of in a weird directory that is hard for anyone to accept access without

122
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,840
You know root privileges or something like that

123
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,440
Just you want to push your keys?

124
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,000
Into your server, so don't put it in your code base. Don't put in any code base

125
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,040
Don't even put it in a private repository. Just keep them locally and

126
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,680
Push them if you're using docker

127
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,320
Often you'll put these in environment variables

128
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,360
And just push them off to the server, so

129
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,520
That's just a little tip on that because I've seen some issues with that

130
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,880
so

131
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,200
This one is pretty cool. I found a random project where

132
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,520
somebody was doing a map of

133
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,840
github and

134
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,880
This was a pretty neat project. I

135
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,880
Like these kinds of things I

136
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,280
Like especially and like in these where it connects things

137
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,400
I don't know why they're connected probably because they're forks of each other or something like that

138
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:58,320
but I have this page here called map of github and

139
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,760
This is who it's made by and that and Vaca

140
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,840
here I mean

141
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,880
and go to his

142
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,760
And go to his in Seattle

143
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,120
There's a lot of web stuff anyways

144
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,040
here

145
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,400
Here's land of unity so we can zoom in on the land of unity

146
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,440
And you can see a whole bunch of little dots starting to appear as you get closer you get

147
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,080
inundated with a sea of dots and you can

148
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,240
Click on I think the circle yeah, and then you can see all these lines connecting it to things

149
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,840
Why they're connected to those things. I don't know like

150
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,960
Let's go to it page not found. Oh, I guess some of these are broken. How about you?

151
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,480
Outline effect. Oh it has a it looks like it's read me here

152
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,780
Yeah, I think it sticks its read me inside of there

153
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,980
Why is it connected to something else maybe it's a sub repository or something like that. It's just a read me

154
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,240
Oh a view code. I'm not in desktop mode. It's collapsed. Oh

155
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Maybe it's these packages

156
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,880
It's probably these packages

157
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,240
Anyways, I don't want to get it. I don't go Bronson through this stuff

158
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,760
And the podcast but I thought this was really neat if you guys know any projects like these just random stuff

159
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,120
It's like a mind map basically

160
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,480
FBX exporter whoo? Unity FBX exporter

161
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,480
Unity technologies, I guess this oh, this must be the unity's FBX

162
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,600
Exporter plug-in no unity 3d Japan. Oh, maybe anyways

163
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,960
Like I said, I can browse these all day long. So if you have any that you like

164
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,200
Similar to this or you know any language? I

165
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
It doesn't matter to me

166
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,280
I sent him my way. I love to look through these

167
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,040
So I

168
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,240
This is

169
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,480
On a related note

170
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,160
Have you I don't know if you've explored

171
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:19,540
Get the hub before it took me a long and like I've had a github account forever and I never went through the explore tab

172
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,880
Which is hilarious because

173
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,960
That's I mean, I just showed you I like to look around at those kinds of things but a

174
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,680
Few years back. I started using the explore tab

175
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,760
And so you can find things like this one that I shared was game engines

176
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,360
And I've done a video in the past like I don't know a while ago

177
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,160
A couple maybe a year or two ago about all the different game engines that you can find

178
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:53,800
Inside a github for all different kinds of things 2d 3d half-baked all that sort of stuff

179
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,800
Of course, you're gonna have your number one

180
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,480
most starred stuff up here Godot

181
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,120
But you know you'll have

182
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,280
I'm gooey. I am GUI however you want to say it

183
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,400
the popular UI library, so

184
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,240
It's kind of essentially it doesn't

185
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,280
Keep track of the things it creates. It's it's an immediate mode. That's what I am stands for

186
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:24,680
It's an immediate mode where you have to tell it to render stuff what it's rendering kind of every frame

187
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,600
But I'm not gonna go through all these but there's there's all kinds like that

188
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,720
This is a refreshing a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in rust

189
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,160
so

190
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:43,000
I guess bevy must be a popular one for the rust the rust arians rust atonians

191
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
all the rusty's

192
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,280
It's pretty cool

193
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
But there

194
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,600
There I was about say hundreds. There are thousands like there's 5,000. Let me scroll down to the bottom here

195
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:05,080
Maybe it's not at the bottom. There's oh here. It is is at the top. There's almost well. There's

196
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,160
If you round up almost 6,000

197
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:15,480
Almost 6,000 I game engines and you know, some of them are pretty cool

198
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,800
I kind of spent some time perusing these

199
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,200
a

200
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,200
year or two ago and

201
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:28,800
They were there's just some really cool stuff and you can get some pretty cool shaders that people have done

202
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,280
There's a lot of you know available shaders

203
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,320
With like demos and and cool stuff I

204
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,560
I like writing shaders, but I do like

205
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,880
Checking out what other people do because lots of other people are way better at shaders than I am

206
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,360
I don't even I don't even really use shader graphs. I I

207
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,120
Find them too cumbersome for me. I like to hand type it but I

208
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,320
Hate debugging shaders. They take forever

209
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:04,120
So, yeah, I like to look at other people's shaders for inspiration and and that sort of stuff so pretty

210
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
dope

211
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Yeah, if you have some time

212
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,520
Come in here

213
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,520
Feel free to browse through

214
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:20,920
The thousands and thousands and thousands of game engines you'll find one for every language and you'll find one for every scenario

215
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,160
Let's see what you can filter by you filter by star most fewest

216
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,600
most fewest

217
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,200
Most forks that'd be interesting and I've I'd assume it's relative to the stars

218
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,280
All right. Let's find out

219
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,920
Yep, good. Oh, I'm gee. I'm gooey

220
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:44,720
Coco's 2d, I guess it's a little different about the same though. I feel like those two are superfluous

221
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:53,560
Or the forks is superfluous that is the stars kind of is basically same thing I wouldn't recommend fewest stars

222
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,960
You're gonna get tons of zeros and I don't know what order those are in so

223
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,720
Recently updated it might be pretty cool

224
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,280
Coco's creator. Yeah, so if you ever get some time

225
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:12,200
Come out here and explore the github. There's a lot of cool stuff you can

226
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:18,000
Select on topics and you can select different topics based on what you're interested in

227
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,680
One topic that I have saved is C. I love looking through C stuff. I love

228
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,240
getting ideas from from C and look here's OBS

229
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:38,800
But I love just looking through C stuff since it's my favorite language lots of good stuff in there so check it out play around and

230
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,640
Send me if you find if you find some cool stuff

231
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:49,000
Send them my way. I'd love to look I love looking through this stuff. Like I said

232
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,640
So I

233
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,760
Think you know we're coming to the end of this and one of the things that

234
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,640
There's one other thing that bothered me. Hey, I

235
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,120
I'd strongly dislike to end on a sour note, but it's a it's a goofy one to me

236
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,200
There's there's this

237
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,600
Article that was posted and bothered my wife to where I

238
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,800
Don't know if it's called a straw man argument or a gas lighting or what?

239
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,120
But it was about not being able to play Zelda

240
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,240
inside of the

241
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,720
You know Legend of Zelda series. I know

242
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,640
Ironically, you don't play Zelda and Zelda you play as Lincoln Zelda

243
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,760
and I

244
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,720
Don't think this is they made it seem like everyone's gonna be playing Zelda

245
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,720
They made it seem like everybody

246
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,320
Everybody on the planet was wanting this to happen and you could play a Zelda and tons of games

247
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,320
You can play in Zelda, you know Super Smash you can play in Zelda as

248
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,600
What was it called Hyrule Warriors you play Zelda and like tons of like offshoot games

249
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,280
So, I don't know if she's in Mario Kart now she might even be in Mario Kart

250
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,720
I don't understand the need for people to

251
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,800
Come up with problems. Maybe it's because

252
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,520
They're being paid to write articles

253
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,720
And so they've got to figure out how to

254
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,880
Spend their day doing something and so they come up with these weird ghosts that they have to chase

255
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,280
and the way they word it is like

256
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,960
Everybody on the internet wanted this like with no citation of all the people that wanted it

257
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,520
I'm sure there's you know a pocket of people that want to play a Zelda and a Zelda game, but

258
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:36,320
Generally you play Legend of Zelda as link. That's how it's always been. It's a great game for its mechanics

259
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,360
You want to focus on the gameplay you want to focus on all of that sort of stuff. You don't want to have to focus on

260
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,320
character semantics and altering your story and changing your formulas just so you can play as

261
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:54,000
One of the other characters in there and they have lots of characters. It doesn't just have to be Zelda people are complaining

262
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And I mean you could just mod the games if you really want to play a Zelda, but yeah, there's this is the

263
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,960
the article in question

264
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,640
by the gamer comm

265
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,200
Nintendo has no plans to make Zelda a playable character

266
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,560
It's a newsflash big old bold headline right there

267
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,800
No plans. Oh, how dare they?

268
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:25,600
As theories that Zelda would be playable in tears of the kingdom have proven wrong the wrong all those theories

269
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,000
I'd never heard once they're all just

270
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:34,360
And Nintendo even worst of all Nintendo doesn't plan to change anytime soon

271
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,360
Game that makes them millions and millions of dollars and is huge smash hits

272
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,120
They don't want to change it up and you know

273
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:51,520
Potentially alienate audiences. Uh, yeah, it's just I feel like this is I don't know like I said

274
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,000
I don't know if it's straw man or gaslight. It feels like one of those things where

275
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,080
companies point at

276
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,520
News people in general point at something and then they say

277
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,240
What do you think about that? And they point it and they they start asking that to like, you know,

278
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:16,280
What do you think about that and they point it and they they start asking that to like corporations and stuff like trying to get them?

279
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,160
The way on and on stuff they don't need a way in on and in my opinion Nintendo

280
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,720
They make tons of money. They have the IP solid. It's a fantastic

281
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,160
Like everybody loves the characters. Everybody loves the the storyline even though it repeats

282
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:36,440
It's it's a formula that works that people really like they focus on link doing these interesting game mechanics. So

283
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,800
But yeah, they're saying like

284
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,600
However, yet again is not the case yet again. Oh, no

285
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,720
Every single time I'm let down every time I sell the game comes out. It's a smash hit and

286
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,120
I'm always thinking about why couldn't I play Zelda?

287
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,040
Yeah, it's

288
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,080
It's a they even mention

289
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,160
That here we go. Unfortunately has been

290
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:08,320
That has many fans wondering if Zelda these many fans. I don't know where they are

291
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,720
Maybe they meant to put in my ni mini fans a small group

292
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,840
Of her playing in the mainline game and that's the thing is like why does it have to be mainline game?

293
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:24,200
That's why it's like you wanting to make Facebook or something

294
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,960
What's app I just remembered the chat app. That's like saying you want to put what's up on the front page of

295
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:35,320
Facebook it is I don't know, you know, a lot of people use it or like it so might as well

296
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,720
Swap out your main thing for that. It doesn't make much sense business-wise

297
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,120
You you kind of follow the money when you're in a business if you got a formula that works

298
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,600
Especially that's growing as big as Zelda does

299
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,400
Which I think is like their biggest title

300
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,040
You don't go tweak in that much you you make better games

301
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:03,360
Mechanics games are about the mechanics games are not about the characters games are not about the stories both of those things

302
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:10,880
Make games better, but that's not what games are about. They're about what the player does the games are about the player

303
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:16,200
Everybody has to get that in their their minds. The game is for the player and

304
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,840
Is about the player you don't need to pressure them into worrying about all these things. They don't need to worry about

305
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:28,320
You don't need to pressure them into worrying about all these things. They don't need to worry about just let them have fun playing their game

306
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:37,280
Okay, so that was my rant on this particular article, sorry whoever you are this person

307
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,320
This is

308
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,600
This is dumb the waste of I I don't like these kinds of

309
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:52,400
These kinds of articles that point at random ghosts and say why isn't that the way it's I think it should be

310
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,480
You know so anyways I

311
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,560
Haven't played by the way just a side note. No, don't spoil anything for me. I have not played the new Zelda game. I

312
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,320
Can't play it. You see I'm about to have a baby

313
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,400
I'm very excited about this baby, and I can't get sucked into a video game

314
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:17,920
Just as I'm about to have a baby. She'll be here any day now, and I probably won't be able to play

315
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,240
This is all that unfortunately, and I really do want to play it

316
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,960
I probably won't be able to play it for a few months until you know, she's stable

317
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,680
You know, my wife is all healed up and feeling better. I

318
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,440
I've already got a child to I'm gonna be looking after my son

319
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Basically the whole time

320
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,560
because he's he's fairly young and

321
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,600
They're they're pretty close in age I can say so I'm gonna have my hands full and I

322
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,640
Though I really want to play this game. I'm gonna have to hold off on it. So no spoilers for me

323
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,920
Don't tell me anything

324
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,200
You can tell me what you like in general the public stuff like hey, I like

325
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,760
building cars and

326
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,460
trees and spaceships or whatever you but

327
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:09,780
Don't spoil any of the like mechanics. They haven't already kind of exposed or anything like that

328
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,660
I I like to go in blind on these things. In fact, I

329
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,740
goofy story I

330
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:22,540
I like all the side things in games. I haven't even finished beating breath of the wild

331
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,860
I've done everything like mastered all the cooking stuff

332
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:33,300
I've got all the best clothes and the last thing that I need to do is beat the final boss, which is Ganon

333
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:37,020
And presumably I have I like I said, I don't spoil myself on this stuff

334
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:42,020
I haven't even beat him yet because I did everything else and

335
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:48,220
There's a few things I haven't done I something I like to do like there's a few of the

336
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,460
Shrines I haven't completed

337
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,140
so something I like to do is I like to

338
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:59,560
Do all of the side things and then beat the final boss because then it's like a super completionist feeling moment

339
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:06,020
it feels incredible the downside is six years later have to be the boss, but the upside is it feels amazing when I do and

340
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:12,740
Because one of the one of the things that I feel suck is is if you finish the game

341
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,260
Beat the boss and then there's a bunch of side things to do

342
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:21,300
It feels like it's in backwards order like I feel like you should do all of the adventuring

343
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,620
Before you beat the penultimate boss and then say I'm done

344
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,260
That's just me though. I'm sure

345
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:33,020
But that's just what I like to do in games. So games like Grand Theft Auto

346
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:37,820
games like I don't even know what the main story quest is and

347
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,180
Things like Skyrim. I have no I have no idea at all

348
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:48,840
I just I just get plopped in the world and I do everything but the main story. That's just how I am. So anyways

349
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:56,240
That's my thoughts and thanks for watching I guess I'll see you guys in the next one have a good one bye for now
