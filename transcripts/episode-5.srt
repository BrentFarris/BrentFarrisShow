1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
jobs for programmers some of us need them some of us have them I was curious about remote work and how

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
it affects the job market what companies are doing with remote work I work remotely a lot of you maybe

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
work remotely and just kind of want to take a look at jobs but before I get into remote work I

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
want to take a look at losing jobs lots of people are losing jobs

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
yet another story today not today a couple days ago stack Overflow lays off

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
10 percent of their employees and that's not a lot I was surprised to find out that 10 percent of the stack

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Overflow employee base was 58 employees which is pretty astounding I like that they run a

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
tight ship over there I think that having I mean that means they've got 580

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
employees I think that may be a little bit too high to run a question and answer site

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I don't know I don't run a question and answer site I just think that oftentimes

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
we hire too many developers we hire way too many people and that's usually what

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
is uh slowing us down at companies interworking with people

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
so perhaps they're figuring figuring this out and you know laying off people I've

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
always said that programming is not an assembly line job you can't just add

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
more programmers and then all of a sudden magically produce tons more code there's been

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
studies of this that show that that's never the case you can look at the mythical man month from the 70s and that

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
still holds true believe it or not they did hire tons of programmers at companies even back then when there

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
weren't that many so just taking a look at something like that and that information has basically

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:60,000
held true this entire time we can start to see that you can't just

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
hire more programmers and more developers and expect things to go faster it's just not how it works

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
in fact I think the CEO of Nintendo he

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
famously was shown mother three I don't know which one it was Mother the uh the

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
game that has like Ness as the main character I think it's Ness I don't know who it is kid with baseball cap and uh

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and uh the baseball bat

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
so it's it's this RPG and they presented it to him and he said this is going to take forever to

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
fix and so he said we can get it done in six

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
months if we start over from scratch and that's what they did they started over in scratch and I think it took seven or

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
eight months to complete the game and get it published and that just shows you that

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:60,000
sometimes having a lot of Legacy code it's easier just to scrap it all and do it from scratch and I'm a big proponent

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
of that however it's very hard to pull off in this day and age

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
anyways uh we have so stack Overflow fired or laid off I don't know is that

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
any different than firing I think it's the more PC language but they fired 58 employees which is 10 of their Workforce

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
they were saying that the CEO stack Overflow perhaps uh or his name is Pratt

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I can't I can't even pronounce it pronounce his name I'll call him PC that says initials

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
um said that layoffs uh were also a result of taking a hard look at our strategic

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
priorities this fiscal year and the organizational

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
structure and that's usually how it goes they look in CEO we have a lot of bloat we had a Heyday during you know that

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:60,000
pandemic hired people maybe for things we didn't need and now we're kind of overpopulated and slowing

39
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
ourselves down just kind of drudging along once the ship gets bigger it's going to be harder to push it so

40
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
that's essentially um you know as vague as it is why Let It Go

41
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
the they want to pursue agility and flexibility with the launch of AI ml

42
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
focused offerings in the months ahead so everybody's going AI obviously I think

43
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
everybody can can look around and see that every company I mean most of Google

44
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I O is just AI that's the buzzword that's what everybody's expecting it's

45
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
where all the investors are going even though they probably wouldn't have touched it with a 10 foot a 10-foot pole like five years ago

46
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
and so a stack Overflow is in Jeopardy honestly when you have

47
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
a I mean I'm I think I've seen articles about a dip in their user base ever

48
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
since like um chat GPT was announced and GitHub co-pilot and these kinds of AI generated

49
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
code and I can see why it's very easy to just write a comment in your code it's a

50
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
save a file and it detects the language and it gives you basically what you

51
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
would have went to stack Overflow for a little copy and paste snippet so I don't know exactly what they're going to do

52
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
with artificial intelligence I think the only way they can save themselves is if they compete with things like copilot

53
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
and they produce an artificial intelligence that takes the entire base of knowledge of stack Overflow and all the

54
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
suggestions there and kind of works from that although

55
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Microsoft's you know they bought GitHub for a reason and I was to have access to

56
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
all the code on GitHub whether we like it or not to train their AIS so they have a much bigger code base

57
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
to work from so that that's that's you know just nature

58
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
of the business but I don't want to focus too much just on stack overflow um

59
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
ironically and this one is is ironic to me because we all know about all the

60
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
layoffs that are happening there's layoffs at every big company you can think of games software nobody is safe

61
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
in the um software Realm and the I don't want to say the funniest

62
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
but it is kind of funny LinkedIn Cuts 700 jobs and closes their China app so I

63
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
can understand why they close their China app I mean that's a whole other discussion about you know

64
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Chinese firewall and kind of their regulatory stuff that

65
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
makes it very difficult to do stuff there so besides the point but they cut 700 jobs at LinkedIn

66
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
um it's ironic because you would imagine with everybody getting laid off from every big company there's a lot of

67
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
people who are going to be paying for LinkedIn and trying to get jobs so it's

68
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
weird to me that a job search website and I I have an article here that says

69
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
let's see um here let's take a look

70
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
says more than 197 000 Tech sector employees have lost

71
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
their jobs since the start of 2023. this isn't even talking about 2022.

72
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
um so you know 200 000 people looking for jobs and Linkedin is uh they're cutting they're cutting 700 jobs from

73
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
from their company which does that mean people are not looking

74
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
for jobs does it mean they're not looking through Linkedin or they just is LinkedIn just not a viable thing for

75
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
finding jobs I don't know what to take of this um I've I've gotten jobs through

76
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Linkedin recruiters so it's a little strange to me I think that it's pretty effective there's a lot of

77
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Recruiters on there and there's a lot of noise daily I get I get recruiters hitting me

78
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
up for jobs I sometimes feel like I need to close down my thing whenever I I take

79
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
a job that I'm happy with but there's a lot of recruiters and there's it seems to be a lot of jobs

80
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
because I you know I get them for artificial intelligence games mobile

81
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
apps just the whole Spectrum so I don't know uh so it's very odd I don't

82
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
know what to take of it I don't know if it's a a good omen a bad Omen that they're cut jobs but something to think

83
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
about um but they're not the only ones so um it looks like May 3rd Unity conducts

84
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
a third round of layoffs this is the unity game engine um if you're not a game developer that's

85
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
the one I'm talking about uh they've they've cut uh something about eight

86
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
percent of their staff which is another 600 people getting laid off and I guess this is a third round I

87
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
have no idea what happened in the first couple of rounds uh how many people went got laid off in that and so

88
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
um very interesting again games are doing great right now but

89
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I don't know if if it's just the trend all the big Tech Bros are talking to each other at their

90
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
yacht meetups or whatever rich people do and saying hey look we can just cut a

91
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
whole bunch of jobs look Elon Musk did it you like cut Twitter to nothing and uh still the thing is running and you

92
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
know tons of people are using it and it hasn't totally collapsed maybe we could do the same I don't know

93
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
um but usually once one person does it it really starts a chain reaction they

94
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
all realize hey maybe we're bloated we need to save some money inflation is happening all kinds of weird stuff's

95
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
happening um you know banks are collapsing maybe we should start cutting people to save

96
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
money I don't know uh but it's very interesting um you know it's affecting everybody

97
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
from games to software to tech companies is the whole Spectrum even LinkedIn if

98
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
linkedin's being hit and you know everything's being hit it's uh that's the way I see it so

99
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I have uh I did I did see something

100
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
um from times now news amid Mass layoffs uh there's a particular I.T company an

101
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Indian I.T company that is hiring like 1500 people and that's not unheard of I actually was

102
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
fired I will call it fired laid off whatever you want to call it

103
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
um I was laid off it was it was part of uh I was part of a studio a game studio

104
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
and we were making money we the company was already bought once and they were about to be bought again and they

105
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
decided to lean up and what they did was they brought in a bunch of um I don't know if they were uh I never

106
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
asked them I think they were Russian they may have been Ukrainian the guy

107
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
that was kind of communicating with them and working with them he was Russian so I don't know what the people on the

108
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
other end was they didn't really explain it much but after working with them and

109
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
they got integrated with the team they laid off everybody in the United States

110
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
for that company and offshored everything so it makes perfect sense

111
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
that it'd be offshoring you know offshore companies would be hiring tons

112
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
and tons of new new people and that could be exactly what it is it's uh you

113
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:60,000
know I think that's going to be unnecessary with all the AI stuff that

114
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
we're creating because um it can do it much more efficiently and you can have one programmer who's a

115
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
little more effective Maybe he's got a he's got a no code you can't

116
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
just hire anybody to just put in prompts for AI you got to have somebody who knows code inside and out so I guess the

117
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
upper echelons of coders your jobs are safe so don't worry about

118
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
that so there's been a lot of layoffs Intel

119
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
did more layoffs on May 9th it looks like so you've got

120
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Intel and Google Amazon meta Microsoft and just tons of companies just even

121
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
this month laying off people and I think that we're tired of seeing all the headlines

122
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
because we've seen them basically every month for like a year but it's still going and

123
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
that's uh that's pretty crazy luckily I've not had any problems with

124
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
this um you know since way back when and that scenario I was talking about but it is

125
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
unfortunate for a lot of people I I don't know how to deal with job security there when you're in a huge

126
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
company like these uh some of these big companies Intel Microsoft they'll probably cut important people

127
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
not not even knowing they just need they just need big sections to just disappear

128
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
so that they can uh kind of Reserve their funds so that's that's

129
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
kind of the crazy stuff that's going on in the job stuff I'm not worried at all if you're secure in your job

130
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
you don't have to worry uh if you're a really good programmer and you know many languages and you can go

131
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
cross-discipline you really don't have to worry you're going to be fine so

132
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
and if you do get laid off like I said I get I get tons of stuff in LinkedIn I know there's stuff out there for you so

133
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
if you are laid off if you're not something to think about everything's

134
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
good that brings us to remote work so I

135
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
started to think about remote work today because um Elon Musk did a long interview and

136
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
one of the things that came up with that was remote work you you probably know elon's point of view on remote work

137
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
and um you know I'm somewhat ambivalent to

138
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
remote work I think that it has its benefits for those of us uh like me who

139
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
have family and a place that's not so techy and it has its huge downsides which will

140
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
also kind of cover so uh kind of what he went over today

141
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
was he opposes the work from home policies and called out remote work and

142
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:61,000
said it was morally wrong he suggested that work from home policies and are fundamentally unfair since every

143
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
employee can work from home pointing to a factory uh appointing to factory and

144
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
food workers so um and basically what he's saying is

145
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
there they're kind of I don't know if you want to call them Elites who can work from

146
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
home people like me who have a job that pretty much is all done on the web and then you have the

147
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
other part of the society who are equally important in holding up the

148
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
society and producing food and working in factories and and keeping everything

149
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
we enjoy afloat and there is an unfairness to that and it

150
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
could cause social tension I think is is his perspective on this

151
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
um he he mentioned uh like Emma Amazon and apple want their employees to go

152
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
back to office which is true game companies like blizzard um and you know Microsoft want that as

153
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
well and it's it's kind of a big push to get back to office

154
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
um for employees uh the remote work benefits are obvious and you know that's that's kind of what

155
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
what was said that's like a quick summary of what was said in that now

156
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
my perspective on remote work I know that I have a bias

157
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
but I also understand this point of view I understand the unfairness factor to

158
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Society of course there's always been uh you know a disparity between say

159
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
programmers who sit and don't have to do much um you know we're not lifting heavy

160
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
weights or heavy things and risking our lives like other people are doing and

161
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:60,000
then other people do that and somehow programmers get paid more and it is it

162
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
all comes down to capitalism supply and demand um you know it's it's for example if

163
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
computers just died today I'd probably be able to pick up and learn um construction or something like that

164
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
as long as I'm mobile and able and that's not so easy like if all if

165
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
all the lumber in the world disappeared and all we had were computers it would be much more difficult for someone in

166
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
construction to say take a role that I work in and that's not to say one is harder than the other or anything like

167
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
that it's just that's just how capitalism works it's a supply and demand scenario and it can be

168
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
unfair but you know it's it's created the greatest nation in the world and uh the greatest Prosperity that the world

169
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
has ever seen because we do share a lot of our prosperity so it's unfortunate I have no solution

170
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I have no opinion on a solution I I'm just a I'm just a family man who wants to feed his kids

171
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
so from the perspective of working from home

172
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I've worked with a lot of people who work from home for the last couple of years I mean my job all the way up till

173
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
2020 was going to the office and I would take a

174
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
train two hours to get there and two hours back because I wanted to live in a different place than the job was or it

175
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
was way too expensive to live where the job was so I sacrificed four hours of my day five

176
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
days a week just to get to and from work and I I was on trains where people on

177
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
the train before me were attacked by people with machetes and you know I've seen quite a few weird

178
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
things on the train so you know I prefer not to do that

179
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
especially now that I have children so there is like a rah-rah and a lot of

180
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
people who are remote work from home they have this like let's band

181
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
together and not allow it to happen now I would like to say if you could make

182
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
yourself valuable now this is the same thing between programmers so you have a you have a value hierarchy of supply and

183
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
demand within programmers you have programmers who there's a lot of supply and uh you know or yeah there's a lot of

184
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
supply and the demand is met but then you have jobs that are much higher

185
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
difficulty that have a very low supply of programmers and has a very high demand now I would

186
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
argue that if there's a huge supply of programmers for a particular job

187
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
then a company may be in their in their rights to say come into work and that's because you don't really have

188
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:60,000
arguing power there you don't you can't fight for your position you can't do something like that now programmers who

189
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
are in much lower Supply let's say their systems programmer game engine programmers those sorts of people

190
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
um you have bargaining power it's hard to find people in that realm and you could

191
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
say hey I'll take a little bit of a pay cut let me work exclusively from home and

192
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
we've got a deal and companies would gladly do that and they even before the

193
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
whole pandemic people would have these companies would have gladly done it I've worked with people who worked remote

194
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
so that I think just on the perspective of remote work there is uh

195
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
you know you don't have a right to just want to do it your way and the reason I say this is because I've worked with a

196
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
lot of programmers who work remote who don't do much of anything uh they I know

197
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:60,000
they came in late came in late they push off things they go to a lot of

198
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
meetings and just work doesn't get done and you can tell because timelines get

199
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
pushed all the time and part of that is the hierarchy of the business you know

200
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
management and all that stuff and having too many programmers and that's a whole other thing to to

201
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
look at now one thing I will say is I do miss working in person it is something that I

202
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
do miss I I actually liked going in and the camaraderie and you know making the jokes and eating with the eating with

203
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
the co-workers and talking about code and projects and Concepts and ideas and game designs and hunting and just random

204
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
stuff I do miss that and you know the free lunches were awesome too you get free

205
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
lunch every day those those were great a great incentive so there were definitely huge perks that I

206
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:61,000
really miss now as a father I love being at home with my kids so

207
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
working remote is a dream come true I the time that I would spend traveling to

208
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
go to work to come from work can be spent with my children and really

209
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
there's that's there's no there's nothing that compares it's it's the dream so though I do miss the social

210
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
aspect of talking to people and that does um you know as a downside there is an upside to to being with my family

211
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
you gotta pay somewhere you can't get everything for free now people who don't have families I'm sorry but

212
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
you know I would even encourage you to go to work staying at home all day is not good for your mental health if you

213
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
don't have families uh even if you just have a wife and you don't have kids it's not good for you just to be at home all

214
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
day locked in a room same room every day nobody around you that's that's not healthy and I would say try maybe

215
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
you know going into work when they have those uh they have uh pretty much every

216
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
job has open desks for you to go in and work the problem there is if nobody else

217
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
is there then you're just in a bigger room alone and you had to travel to get there so there is kind of an incentive

218
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
in that way for companies to request people to come in to work so that people

219
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
can see each other so that it gives incentive to people who want to come in maybe not all the time to come in

220
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
it's a very difficult situation I understand the perspective as a work from home person who does not want to

221
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
change it because I have children I will say though if I didn't have children I'd be going back to work I

222
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
would actually be going in I would probably get a different job that was closer to me so I didn't spend four hours traveling

223
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
but I would likely go into work because I just I love that social atmosphere of being

224
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:61,000
with like-minded people working together that sort of thing it's I just miss it

225
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
so really the only reason I don't is my kids so that's that's kind of

226
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
the two sides of the coin I feel the upsides like I said previously of

227
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
working from home for even for people without kids are obvious uh lower cost of living

228
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
for example I I lived in a high cost area and in 2020 I moved

229
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
back to be with family and just my entire you know extended family were

230
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
really close so by doing that my cost of living went way down and that was a huge

231
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
benefit to me and made it much more comfortable to raise my children and to know that I could provide for

232
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
them a home and everything else so there's just so many benefits from

233
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:60,000
working from home but I do get it and employees are not as

234
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
productive as they could be in office this is why if you remember before 2020 wework was booming I think

235
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
it's dead now because of everything that happened but it was booming because people would leave home

236
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
to rent a space in an office even if it was by themselves if they

237
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
were video editors or whatever just because they it made them more productive or maybe it made them feel

238
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
more productive I don't know but it I think going to have a space to

239
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
work at especially with others does make you more productive in general it's a lot easier to talk to people

240
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
now at my last company what we did is we had a Discord Channel and we had a kind

241
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
of a structure that segmented the programmers into five groups and my group would be in Discord all day long

242
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
and we had push to talk so we'd press a button and talk and it was kind of like being in the office because there was a

243
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
lot of banter we made some jokes we we made you know as as employers as employees do with

244
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
each other made inappropriate jokes made it just just had you know shooting the breeze and having a lot of fun but we

245
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
also did of course use that to talk about random problems so there wasn't a

246
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
meeting barrier where we'd have to set up a meeting to talk about something we just press a button say hey yo you know

247
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I have this problem were you guys seen it you guys know what's going on and they would just respond it's very simple

248
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
uh also meetings I think exploded I don't even want to get into meetings anyone who has a job in programming

249
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
knows meetings are useless I I think this is just to pad the hours of the day

250
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
and people uh they say oh hate meetings but then they they make the meetings go really long

251
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
because they don't want to get back to work you know get back to work they want to

252
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
be able to go into the stand up the next day and say oh you know I had meetings

253
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
for this and that and that and this other meeting and you know meetings all day so it was really hard to get anything done

254
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
um that's that's common it's not as common as my current job my last job super

255
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
common current job I think is a lot more streamlined and they're they're pretty

256
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
effective at kind of managing those meetings at least for me others maybe not but at least for me and the one I

257
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
work at has tons of remote workers they hire tons of people knowing they're out of state even I'm out of state and you

258
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
know everybody on my on the engine team is out of state from the actual office

259
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
so I think they've just they're much more educated and well-versed in how to work

260
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
with uh work with remote people manage the time and get things done so

261
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
it is kind of up to the business if it's a big business it's hard to do that so

262
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:61,000
at big businesses you're going to see big businesses calling people in the at the more medium-sized ones uh you know

263
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
or sub Studios you're probably going to see a lot more remote work so that's my

264
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
long rant on remote work and like I said it has

265
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
emotional health uh benefits and negatives I think there's a lot of

266
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
benefits for families people with children I think that there's a lot of negatives for people who are just a look

267
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
you know I don't want to say alone but you know they they're not married or they don't have kids maybe their spouse

268
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
goes somewhere to work or their spouse is just in another room all day I can see there being some you know severe

269
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
downsides people are social we want to talk you know I talked to my son who can't

270
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
really make a full he can't even make a full sentence but there's a lot of social to that and I play with them and

271
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
you know it it's I think I fill my social meter if we're talking about the Sims uh pretty effectively with that so

272
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
yeah that's that's kind of the perspective on remote work if you're a remote worker

273
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
get on hey good for you but uh you know I'm not into the whole rah-rah let's

274
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
rally together and never let us never let them make us uh come into the office ever again

275
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I think that there are huge benefits to being in the office in a lot of scenarios and you got to

276
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
choose your battles and you've got to have the skills that are worth uh worth

277
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
it to the company to argue for remote work in my opinion so that's that's the perspective on remote

278
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
work all right due to there not being a whole

279
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
lot of news today I suppose everybody is talking about Sega raising its price to seventy

280
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
dollars for games now I have heard the argument games have

281
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
been the same price for you know many many years uh-huh I hear you I mean it it has

282
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
raised you know 10 bucks once before and 10 bucks again I hear that argument

283
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
um you know it would be a valid argument if all the methods of distribution were

284
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
exactly the same the difference is that all the methods of distribution have changed a lot of

285
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
people buy digital I would probably think that most people buy digital just

286
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
look at steam sales and those those digital sales still

287
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
being you know full box price um is crazy to me it's crazy that the

288
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
price is so high it's crazy that we're going to seventy dollars we're going to be at like a hundred dollars soon and I

289
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
get that there's inflation and the whole economy thing and you know that's going haywire

290
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:60,000
but still the seventy dollars for a game that's a lot of money for people

291
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
and you know you just can you can imagine everybody from you know kids who

292
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
just started working who left their parents house maybe they're they're starting their career and they're

293
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
starting to work and develop their skills they want to go home and play games too and you're kind of limiting

294
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
them to buying one game a year or something like that like one that you can't you can't buy that many AAA games

295
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
at 70 bucks a pop in those scenarios I know because I had a minimum wage job to start and

296
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I couldn't even buy ice cream so I'd have to in that scenario I'd have to save seventy dollars somehow

297
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
because I had rent and everything else to pay um so I wouldn't even be able to buy AAA

298
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
games I got to wait till they go on sale but then you have companies like Nintendo that just don't go on sale for for whatever reason and since they never

299
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
go on sale and they keep their games at top at their top price even when you want to buy used uh you're paying like

300
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
52 bucks and uh that's that's insane how are you gonna how you gonna play any of these games

301
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
you really want to play in that perspective it's it's unheard of so raising it to 70 that's a ten dollar

302
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
jump and you have digital distribution it does not cost you the same that it

303
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
would cost you to put a box on the Shelf of a store because you have to make all

304
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
that box art you have to produce it you have to publish it you have to work with the warehouses and shipping and

305
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
distribution and overseas shipping and all of that sort of stuff

306
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
you don't have to do that anymore you just click a button and download it and server space is cheap man with you know

307
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
so many Cloud providers competing in the space it's cheapest they're cheap especially when you buy it at scale it's

308
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
incredibly cheap so going up to 70 dollars for games I I feel like

309
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
is it's kind of it's a it's a real shame because I remember myself in that

310
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
scenario and this would have just made it so I couldn't play any games at all I'd have to play like the throwaway

311
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
sports games that everybody has as a game collector and if any of you collect

312
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
games you know exactly what I'm talking about the wall of sports games uh it would be like all you could afford so

313
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I think another problem uh why the prices have gone up is the same thing with the the companies

314
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
they over staff they over budget they spend way much way

315
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
too much time managing and meetings and planning and jira and tasks and all this

316
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
sort of nonsense uh they they waste so much money and hire

317
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
way too many people to to make a video game and we have you know I can't

318
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:61,000
compare games now to games from the 90s where you had like five dudes working on

319
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
it Nintendo and they'd produce a hit title of course games are way more

320
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
complicated now you know there's there's way more to them and there's a lot of higher expectations I get that

321
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
but at the same time you know back then they didn't they had to make their own tools to make it work

322
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
now you've got Unity you've got Unreal Engine you can do a motion capture with

323
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
pretty cheap equipment now it's super cheap to do motion capture to set up a motion capture studio and the studios of

324
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
work that just have one uh and just just to have one or whenever they need it

325
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
it's it's really inexpensive nowadays it's not we're not talking like 50 Grand

326
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
to set up a to set up a mocap Studio people can set up mocap with I remember

327
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
like six or almost yeah six or ten years ago

328
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:60,000
somewhere in there people were getting a whole bunch of uh what are they called

329
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
the the Microsoft Connect they're getting a whole bunch of those and you get like three or five of them and you

330
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
can you connect them together and you had mocap basically that you sure had to

331
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
clean up but what mocap don't you have to clean up and you know it's it's way cheaper now so

332
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
it's way cheaper to produce you have all these tools made for you you don't need crazy you don't need an army of engine

333
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
programmers you you just kind of you know you need game programmers and they use the tools that exit pre-exist and

334
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
the engine you have tons of tools from online you've got all the third party

335
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
tools like blender is free even you know Affinity or or Adobe Photoshop and all

336
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
that sort of stuff and you have ai now you have libraries of PBR materials just so much stuff to

337
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
accelerate your process and being a games at least for the last

338
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
in the last company it took us way too many years to develop a game and that's

339
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
because we remade it multiple times because it wasn't feeling right it wasn't hidden kpis

340
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
so in that part it's kind of your problem the business problem

341
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
um to figure out and maybe with less people you would have a more clear Direction so seventy dollars for a game man that's

342
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
that's a tough Bullet To Bite especially for me I'm I can tell you right now

343
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I have children I'm not going to be spending 70 on a game I will wait until that game goes on sale

344
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
at my local game stores and I will buy it much cheaper or I'll buy it on eBay I

345
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
will not buy top dollar seventy dollar games uh like The Legend of Zelda is out

346
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
right now and I really want to play it first of all I'm about to have a kid so I can't but even so I would much rather

347
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
just wait some number of months to get it at a reasonable price seventy dollars

348
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
is way too much that's that's like how much money I spend at the grocery store

349
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
buying like five things so would I rather eat or would I rather play a game

350
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I'm gonna I'm gonna choose to eat sorry so hopefully people people fight this and

351
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
they they just I don't know stop buying seventy dollar games or just only buy games on sales or

352
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
third party because that's that's crazy that's crazy towns

353
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
but companies Activision Blizzard Electronic Arts uh take two interactive

354
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
which owns a lot of companies by the way uh Playstation Xbox and even Nintendo

355
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
have all raised their prices and so and Sega now have all raised their prices to seventy dollars and it's a shame uh

356
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
that's that's my opinions on that if you have a strong opinion on it let me know maybe a counter argument and let me know

357
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
why we should be paying seventy dollars rather than companies kind of

358
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
you know fixing their Staffing problem and all their other problems to reduce the cost for them so that they can pass

359
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
those savings on to the consumer that's uh that's my thoughts on that

360
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
all right so I'm going to wrap this up with a couple of shorter things so one

361
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
is the Nintendo 64 controller for the switch is now available I mentioned this because I missed out on it

362
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
last time it sold out I missed out on the Super Nintendo controller and I

363
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
bought both of those just now so um those I I do want to play the emulator

364
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
games on the switch using the controllers I remember from my childhood so that's going to be exciting

365
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
if you if you uh if they're still in stock by the time this goes up tomorrow tomorrow morning

366
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
hopefully you can you can grab one if you also missed it um

367
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
and another topic that is near and dear to my heart

368
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
is that OverWatch has uh canceled their PVE hero mode and that sucks I mean I

369
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
don't I'm pretty sure that's going to make tons of people angry now I haven't played OverWatch in some number of months now

370
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
uh I I was an avid player I've played it ever since it launched I have the over

371
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
one I have an OverWatch 2 poster that's signed by the developers because I I loved playing it so much even with all

372
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
its quirks and its biases and it's angry uh it's angry players and all those

373
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
sorts of things um I loved OverWatch I love the characters didn't care much about the

374
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
stories that they put out didn't really I don't I'm not super into stories for games I also don't

375
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
uh I don't like it when they retcon a whole bunch of stuff just to to please people

376
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
um so I just didn't pay attention to the story but the gameplay was awesome the character like the way they the the

377
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
different characters were play it was just a lot of fun it was fun to play the characters their character controllers

378
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
are awesome they're networking for some of its flaws was pretty dang good or is

379
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
pretty dang good so I was super hyped about the PVE mode for

380
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
OverWatch I don't know who else was I've played I've played so much like

381
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
competitive matches and arcade modes that I was ready for a PVE mode

382
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
something where you can have a character you can essentially level them up and

383
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
play with other people play with friends randos doesn't matter I thought it would be such a it'd be a lot less toxic if

384
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
you've ever played competitive or any other part of OverWatch you know it's crazy toxic you can be getting along

385
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
with somebody just fine one mistake and it's over they're just pissed they're just gonna yell at you and they're gonna

386
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
screaming and say I said it's all I don't know choose a character they're

387
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
going to blame somebody they always blame somebody else somebody but themselves

388
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
being a team game if you're not being a team player it's probably you but I don't know the

389
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
matches where you clicked with people and you had fun and you know even if

390
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
there were close matches and you lost or whatever and people are still cool about it that's what I liked and it felt really

391
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
good with that and I thought the PVE would be that I thought it would be that experience that I enjoyed so much

392
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
from the online play playing with people who just were having fun and could

393
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
cooperate and we're just enjoying the game and the you know wasn't nobody was

394
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
being toxic I thought that would be it was going to be just amazing so they scrapped that and of course that

395
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
probably means I won't play anytime soon anymore I mean I like I said I haven't been playing for a few months

396
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
but if they said oh PVE is launching in like a month I would be right back into

397
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
OverWatch getting prepared you know after my new kid is born and

398
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I I man that would have brought me back so fast but man it's just

399
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I'm so disappointed it's that's the hard part is that I'm not angry I'm just

400
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
disappointed because the game was great and I thought this would be like so awesome you know with all the team

401
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
swapping and stuff they did internally at blizzard I can see how these kinds of things happen being on teams of

402
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
programmers and their develop game developers who've had that sort of thing happen in the past I I get it totally

403
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
get it probably super disa the developers themselves are probably super disappointed at the end of the day it's

404
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:61,000
a business they got to make money and the live Services is what makes their money so super disappointed in

405
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
that and uh just so that's a random topic on games and

406
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
now to throw out something for the programmers this is going to be for the

407
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
much more advanced programmers for those of you who are interested in

408
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
multi-threaded applications and verifying your code if you haven't

409
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
used uh it's I guess the language it's a logic checker

410
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
um it's called TLA plus it's been around for quite a while I'm a huge fan of the

411
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
guy who who made it just him personally I can't I can't remember the his name

412
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
off top of my head um I'm gonna have to look it up but he he he worked on he works on

413
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:60,000
algorithms he's a mathematician in the background let's see who made TLA plus

414
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
um he so he comes from this uh algorithms

415
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
background and his Focus was primarily on

416
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
a multi-threaded applications or inter inner communication between computer

417
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
parallel Computing Leslie Leslie Lamport how could I forget LL so TLA plus is a

418
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
way for you to check your multi-threaded code I think it's kind of you know the

419
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
root his favorite algorithm that he came up with the root of it is goes back to the bakery algorithm and I'll leave that

420
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
to you to look up it basically has to do with a man going into the bakery and getting a ticket and you know there's a

421
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
bunch of people tickets and and it's like a multi-threading program and it's an algorithm to solve that problem

422
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
but uh TLA plus if you haven't used it you should use it there's a funny story about it he works

423
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
at Microsoft and Microsoft didn't start using it internally rigorously until Amazon published if

424
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
they were using it and was making their web services so much better and if

425
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
you're doing web stuff if you're doing multi-threaded programming check out TLA plus it it does use logic notation

426
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
um from mathematics it's in ASCII form so you know if you're going to do like an

427
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
and or or you've got to use the forward slash backslash to make the shape

428
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
to do the logic but learning logic notation is not that complicated uh just

429
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
look it up on Wikipedia it's pretty short read and I would highly suggest if

430
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
you haven't used TLA plus this is a PSA you don't see a whole lot on it I I would like you to check it out and I'll

431
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
uh I'll put the the link to an article that I saw recently that got me thinking

432
00:45:59,000 --> 00:45:61,000
about it that kind of talks about the the two-phase pizza party and there's a

433
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
there's a step I think it explains I haven't read through the whole thing but it it looks like it explains uh TLA Plus

434
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
in a basic way to to learn it so I'm going to be posting that in the description I'll put it on the Twitter

435
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
and go check it out if you're in the multi-thread stuff if you're learning multi-threaded stuff if you do web

436
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
things check it out it's going to make your algorithms better and it's going to help you a lot in

437
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
solving problems before they happen lots of problems happen with concurrency on

438
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
the web and this is a great way to solve that so that's it for today I know it was a

439
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
lot of rant about jobs but there's been a lot of things going on about it there's that interview with Elon Musk

440
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
who really got me thinking about it and those are my perspectives on that I'd like to hear your perspectives if you

441
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
have any how you feel I'm sure most of you have been doing remote work as developers and I want to know what you

442
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
think maybe from the perspective of somebody who doesn't have children and

443
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
how you feel about that because I remember I started remote work without children

444
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
and I thought it was the most incredible thing in the world but I don't know what it would be like a few years into it and

445
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
still being you know not flying solo you may have had a girlfriend or wife or whatever but kind

446
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
of that aspect of it I'm really curious on on your perspective on that so let me know anyways have a good one and bye for

447
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
now
