00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,520
Good morning. It's odd. I'm recording in the morning today

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,600
What you may have noticed was I guess the the main thing people are gonna be talking about is gonna be that

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,440
Reverend governor governor Ron DeSantis announced his presidential race on Twitter

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,920
No, I'm not political. I don't

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,760
Whatever you believe is what you believe. Everybody should research

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:32,440
Everything don't just pick a side just research things and choose what's best for you. And sometimes that means

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,920
Voting across the aisle on things believe it or not

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,680
so

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,680
why am I interested in talking about the

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,400
Ron DeSantis

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,920
announcement of his presidential campaign on Twitter

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,840
Well, I think there's a couple of things. I the main thing is it was pretty neat to see

13
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,200
the Twitter being able to support something like

14
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,080
300,000 people in a room and of course

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,560
all the

16
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,080
I'm sure all the news outlets are gonna talk about the botched initial

17
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,120
run of the

18
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,640
the whole thing

19
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,720
because

20
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,880
it was ran from Elon Musk's account and he has some hundred and forty million followers or something like that and

21
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,360
then you combine that with half a million people listening to the Twitter spaces and

22
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,440
that I think is a

23
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:33,400
Tiff huge technical challenge to be able to host that many people in real time. Of course. I have some questions like

24
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,960
when you talk on Twitter spaces with that many people is it delayed as it's

25
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,640
syndicating the the communication across all these servers or was it taken down because

26
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,320
Was it I'm just curious on whether it was taking down because it scaled too fast too many servers spun up too quickly

27
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,120
or

28
00:01:53,120 --> 00:02:00,520
Was it taken down because maybe it's it's trying to simultaneously send all of this information all in one go

29
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,480
which

30
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,720
is

31
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,240
difficult

32
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,240
300 300,000

33
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,680
People listening it's 300,000

34
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:16,440
Streams of audio it needs to send out and that's that's a pretty that's a pretty difficult task for for

35
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,600
any

36
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,360
infrastructure, so

37
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,280
That was super interesting now on the more

38
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,360
I guess

39
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,520
Human level of the whole thing. I think that

40
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,560
politicians

41
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,800
launching on on things like

42
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,080
social media is very interesting because now we're seeing the politicians move from

43
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,160
And we've seen the shift where politics moves from the realm of television

44
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,960
You know how people get their information that way so they move from going on the road

45
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,680
Driving around talking to people in towns. They still do that obviously

46
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,320
But then they move from that and then they moved on to the internet and then they moved

47
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:07,120
Or they moved to TV and then they moved to internet and now they're moving even further away from from kind of more traditional

48
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,480
Ways of doing it and I think

49
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,560
it also is interesting because

50
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,200
You know normally we watch these

51
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,000
Politicians they go up on a stage and they've spent I don't know a million dollars or something on this production

52
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,440
And having all these people come in and you know

53
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,120
They play it they've they've paid some rock and roll artists to play their music while they walk on stage

54
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,880
to a huge fanfare like there's some sort of rock star and

55
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,960
To me politicians are just dudes that are supposed to go and you know

56
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,280
I vote for them and they do what I voted for or something like that

57
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,440
I don't I don't I didn't vote for a rock star

58
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,600
I think it's weird to to have this this whole thing personally personally now you like I said

59
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,440
There's no right way if you like them going on stage like a rock star to a cheering fan like playing all this music

60
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,440
That's your thing

61
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,080
The Rhonda Santas announcement on Twitter circle was not that it was it was almost like a podcast

62
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,160
is

63
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:16,240
Quiet is straightforward. There's some weirdness that comes that came with the start because you know

64
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,920
The dudes talking as if he's talking to a crowd that's gonna cheer and and you know

65
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:28,560
That's just how politicians talk. I mean, they have a way of speaking for for crowds and

66
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:36,400
You know when when you're done speaking is just quiet and the guy then the next person goes say, okay, let's ask some questions

67
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,760
so it was definitely an interesting experience whether you love them or hate them and so

68
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,120
that whole experience of I mean

69
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,960
You could see it pop up in your head and you're like, okay, okay

70
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:57,720
I mean you could see it positively that you know I don't know how much money is

71
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:03,800
spent in in politics on announcing that you're running for a presidential race

72
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,260
on Twitter. I feel like it's maybe eight dollars a month or whatever governments

73
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:14,840
pay but you know rather than having this stage and paying for music and all this

74
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:22,040
other stuff it seems very dare I say it conservative to announce kind of on this

75
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:29,680
more or less like less fanfare-y kind of scenario. It's interesting. Now I'm not

76
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,680
talking directly about Ron DeSantis himself. He's had plenty of these kinds

77
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,760
of rallies and stuff and in fact inside of the spaces he asked for you to go

78
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:42,040
fund his account or whatever his political account. I don't send

79
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,000
politicians money. They figure out how to make lots of money on their own.

80
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But yeah it's nice to see something so I don't know it felt more

81
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,600
human in many ways because it wasn't just some dude yelling at you on a stage

82
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,600
to some rock and roll band or something. It was you know there was that initial

83
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,360
you know rah-rah but then there's just a bunch of questions like you're just

84
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,800
talking to the dude and people came in and out and I don't know. It was

85
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,360
definitely interesting take and that's that's kind of my perspective on what

86
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:24,040
happened with the Ron DeSantis Twitter announcement. So yeah if you don't want

87
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,280
to check it out don't check it out. It's not that interesting. It's

88
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:35,600
definitely boring like every political thing on the planet but the technology

89
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,800
wise and seeing that there was that many people listening live and

90
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,160
imagining kind of the server stack and all this sort of stuff that had to go

91
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,400
behind the scenes and it's interesting that also that Twitter

92
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,320
recovered pretty quickly from what I understand. The first one crashed and

93
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:58,240
then the second one spun up pretty quick and they were able to diagnose the

94
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,880
issue I think was related to Elon Musk having 140 million people and

95
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:07,520
syndicating to that many people. Their servers couldn't handle so they used

96
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,480
some other dude I don't know his name is they used his account. Much smaller

97
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,920
follow base and I looked at his follow base just to see you know what was the

98
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,760
difference and why would you know how much does it can these Twitter circles

99
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,760
handle and he had like 500,000 followers so way way way way way way less than

100
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:37,760
Elon Musk and I think that was why it was able to kind of sustain. Yeah I'm

101
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:43,000
interested to see what kind of technology that what kind of special

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,200
magic that Twitter uses for syndicating their Twitter circles or spaces or

103
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:52,080
whatever it's called. It's interesting. Now I would be disappointed if it's just

104
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,840
spin up a whole bunch of AW2 instances which is if you don't know Amazon web

105
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,600
services they host like they allow you to host web servers for reasonable price

106
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,320
and you can spin up these servers and tear them down depending on demand and

107
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,800
how much throughput you have on the network so how many people are trying to

108
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,240
access it. And then they have back-end load balancers so it can detect where

109
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,400
you're trying to to connect from to the server and then the load balancers can

110
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:28,080
direct you to the servers that have less less people on those servers and closer

111
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,720
to those people so they can spin up servers near where people are listening

112
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:39,400
or viewing the content so yeah be disappointed if it was just AW2

113
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:50,000
EC2 scaling so yeah I don't know I'd like to see a postmortem

114
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,920
technical report on this particular tech because you know it's not video. Video

115
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,800
streaming is another thing but we already know through Twitch and all

116
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,280
these other platforms that video streaming is just highly delayed and I

117
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:10,360
don't think spaces is delayed that much because one of the key parts of its

118
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,680
technology is you can just bring somebody from the audience and start

119
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,400
talking to them in real time. Now you know behind the scenes when you bring

120
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,480
somebody from the audience to speak perhaps it it changes the server but

121
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:29,240
that would be a huge disconnect if you are listening somebody says oh let me

122
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,160
get somebody in here and then they pull them in and they start talking to them

123
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,040
if there was a delay in anywhere in that in the audio it would be a really weird

124
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,120
experience for that person coming in. They would be hearing something from you

125
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,440
know some time in the past and then just all of a sudden be pulled in to speak

126
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,440
and they wouldn't know what they're speaking about. So I think that it has to

127
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,200
be real-time just for that scenario. So very interesting tech I'd like to know a

128
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,400
little bit more on that I think. So if you so happen to know what they do there

129
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,200
I haven't I mean I guess I can go online and see if they have done a blog post or

130
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:12,240
anything but yeah just let me know be pretty freaking sweet. So beyond the

131
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:20,480
politics and the tech behind politics there's a whole bunch of little things

132
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,640
that happened in tech recently and also in science. I wanted to share this

133
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:34,800
because it completely ruined my childhood. So there is this article here

134
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,880
you know these dinosaurs hold on let me fix this you know these dinosaurs that

135
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,600
have the the dome head and you just imagine that they always bash each other

136
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,720
in the head whenever they were you know you saw it in in was Littlefoot what is

137
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:57,960
the end anyways and the Littlefoot movies Land Before Time. They would bash

138
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,760
each other's heads and you know any dinosaur movie even Jurassic Park I

139
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,000
believe had a few of these dudes and they would bash each other's heads. Well

140
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,120
the the article here I don't know where the title went but it basically describes

141
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,960
that oh here it is a new study suggests that dome-headed dinosaurs did not butt

142
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,200
heads with each other and that ruined my childhood. Like what are they supposed to

143
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,600
do with those heads? Are they thinkers? Did they all just you know these were

144
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,360
the smart dinosaurs and they I don't know it still looks like a tiny section

145
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,240
based on the size of their skull. If you don't know normally we we measure brain

146
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,880
power based on the size of the body I think is the easiest way to explain it.

147
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:48,880
So that's why birds are smart but whales are dumb is the the size of the brain

148
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,880
relative to the the size of the entity matters and so people's brains make up

149
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,800
you know a pretty good chunk like this part of their head and if people are

150
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,360
about five or six head tall and half of their head is dedicated to the brain

151
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:13,160
you know that's that's why we that's why we smart or sometimes smart but anyways

152
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,520
yeah my childhood was ruined. I don't know I don't know if I can like

153
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,240
these dinosaurs anymore without knowing more about them. If they were like you

154
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:29,720
know the the philosophers of the time because they were smart or something

155
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,880
they just had this big old dome you know I don't know maybe I should read this

156
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,080
article at some point I was just I saw the headline and I skimmed through a

157
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:42,040
little bit of the article and disappointment settled. So that was a

158
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:51,720
little fun kind of on the side thing that I was looking at. Okay so to a

159
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:58,040
little bit of a larger thing that has happened recently Microsoft has been in

160
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:05,560
the rounds basically all day yesterday. They had their build announcement which

161
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:10,840
is their you know it's kind of like Google I oh they're not there to sell

162
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,800
products but they partly are there to sell products and they're also there to

163
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:21,280
tell developers. These conferences they start off with a good heart and

164
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:26,720
then wind up like E3 so they do these things they originally do these things

165
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,480
to tell developers about all the APIs and services that are available now to

166
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,480
developers because without developers developing things for your platform you

167
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,720
you're useless nobody's interested. You want people to take all the APIs and the

168
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,080
services that you write and then go and write things on top of it in order to

169
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:50,760
promote your platform. You get more sales, you get more traffic, etc etc. Now I

170
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:57,600
think Google and Microsoft it's kind of like GDC if you guys are game developers

171
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,760
GDC the game developer conference it starts off you know very tech heavy and

172
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,200
all this sort of stuff and sure it's still tech heavy and they go into tech

173
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:10,280
stuff but it slowly creeps into advertising where it's about promoting

174
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,800
your game and showing off the game you're working on and showing off these

175
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,640
technologies for games and selling you products and of course the the

176
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:26,160
conference itself has to make some money and the incentive structure for companies

177
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,200
to go and tell their secrets and all that not really tell their secrets but

178
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,000
just kind of talk about how they develop stuff the incentive structure is they've

179
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,880
got to make money so it does it does make sense that it it would be a natural

180
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,920
progression from talking about tech to trying to sell you products. Anyways the

181
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:52,720
Microsoft build announcements were a lot basically AI lots of AI stuff there was

182
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:59,400
a lot of new Windows 11 things in fact Windows 11 two nights ago updated on me

183
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:06,040
and moved a bunch of stuff around they may have fixed my start menu search so

184
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,480
far so good on that I if if you had that problem you know what I'm talking about

185
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,720
essentially you'd start up your computer you'd hit the start button you start

186
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,600
typing and it was just broken it just didn't work at all it was just

187
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,320
absolutely atrocious you had to hit escape a million times and the open and

188
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,520
close the start menu a few times before it started responding correctly and

189
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,680
where you can type into it and search for things and all that sort of stuff so

190
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,880
that I think is probably the happiest thing for me that came out of that is

191
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:44,360
just fixing my start menu so what all kind of came out of this well if you've

192
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,400
gotten the Windows update Windows 11 update you'll see that there's tabs

193
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:53,760
inside of the folders now when you go into Explorer you can now have multiple

194
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,720
tabs they move some things around I know this just from experience they move some

195
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:06,320
things around and removed for example if you're used to the I'm busy mode on the

196
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,640
was it called like snooze notifications or whatever they've moved that to the

197
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,760
date time so you click on the date time and it's in the top right if you're

198
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,120
curious about that they move that on me you can no longer put it inside of that

199
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:24,600
window that pops up when you click on the battery sound and an Ethernet button

200
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,240
but the most important things that they came out with was all AI stuff they

201
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:35,040
expect to have an AI copilot inside of the web inside of the directly inside of

202
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:43,800
Windows and essentially it's just chat GPT on Windows so that's interesting I

203
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:53,240
feel like it's a little weird because chat GPT all runs on their servers I

204
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,840
mean if you're running Windows are they already collecting all that information

205
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,880
about you or is this kind of a way to to collect a little bit more because this

206
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,520
information has to go somewhere and it goes through chat GPT I don't know what

207
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:13,120
their security or their privacy is for with with Microsoft on this I'm

208
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,560
transferring the data is it stored in chat GPT do they even tell them do they

209
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:24,160
even care I don't know but lots of AI stuff for Windows 11 came out so the

210
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,400
summary I have here is Windows copilot a feature that lets you ask questions and

211
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,000
perform tasks using natural language it can also work with your clipboard

212
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,360
content and system settings so clipboard content I'm not that security line has

213
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,320
already been broken for for me because you can like turn on history of copy

214
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:53,280
paste which is stored on Windows servers from what I recall because you can use

215
00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:00,120
it across machines so that's not a huge surprise security there that's already

216
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,480
in my opinion insecure I have that feature off I think it's pointless

217
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:11,240
there's no reason to have clipboard content go to the Internet but in

218
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,480
general Windows copilot is essentially chat GPT on steroids on Windows it does

219
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,840
have some cool stuff you can ask it to search for documents or summarize

220
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:28,200
documents or convert speech to audio or audio to text and as far as I saw and a

221
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,280
bunch of other stuff so imagine just having a thing on Windows that can

222
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,040
understand more human language and convert that into doing tasks such as

223
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,800
changing system settings and opening up things and summarizing things and finding

224
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:50,480
things I imagine you'd be able to do stuff like where is some document and

225
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,960
it'll go through the different kind of databases that it has in Windows to

226
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,960
locate the document that sort of stuff so there is some some definite utility

227
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:08,760
there to improve your your productivity on Windows but at what cost like I said

228
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,640
I don't know what the security of all this is there is also being in chat GPT

229
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:18,960
being is now the default search engine for chat GPT a popular conversational AI

230
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,400
everybody knows what chat GPT is this will enable chat GPT to obtain new

231
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,840
information and answer more questions being in chat GPT will also share

232
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,360
plugins so is this just being going in a chat GPT like they're taking a Bing

233
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:39,600
model that does the internet searchings and just kind of fusing the two so now

234
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,640
it's a pipeline between being in chat cheap chat GPT so anytime chat GPT kind

235
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,600
of improves something it just automatically goes to being that'd be an

236
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,680
interesting take and probably smart business wise for them but there you can

237
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:59,880
see that Microsoft is is trying to intertwine a lot more with their gigantic

238
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:06,480
multi-billion dollar investment into open AI so I would not be surprised if

239
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,760
Microsoft puts out a deal to buy them or absorb them or Microsoft owns a huge

240
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,440
portion of shares more than just giving the money I don't know I I think we're

241
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,440
gonna see a much deeper integration there one of the main things is that

242
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,720
anyone can use the chat GPT or any of the open AI services themselves with the

243
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:32,280
API and a lot of search engines and various other kind of Microsoft

244
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:38,520
competitors are using that so by integrating themselves into it is an

245
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,600
interesting way to cut out the competition I think that's definitely a

246
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:47,520
business move file Explorer redesign we talked about that a little bit my

247
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,040
summary is Windows 11 we'll have a new file Explorer with modern look and new

248
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:57,360
features blah blah blah it will take a new it will take a new address bar file

249
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,240
actions navigation recommended files and gallery view so I think they're updating

250
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,640
the Explorer because all the different Microsoft things have to be updated to

251
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,960
better interact with this AI these this upcoming AI doom that we will all be

252
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,560
forced to use if we're using Windows Microsoft Store improvements for those

253
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,920
of you might use Microsoft Store I actually do use Microsoft Store every

254
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:25,160
now and then I I like that I can buy for example affinity products on there like

255
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:30,160
affinity photo and just be able to install it on different Windows machines

256
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:36,320
without having to fill around with keys and seats and all that sort of stuff

257
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:42,800
that's it's pretty nice feature for it and Windows 11 features Windows 11 will

258
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:48,440
support a taskbar ungrouping native opening for more archive formats as you

259
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:54,600
know everyone's making the meme about Windows being able to unrar RARS is that

260
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:00,760
what it's calling do you call it unrar ring anyways and you know they're just

261
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,680
more zips format compression formats kind of like limit Linux and Linux pretty

262
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:11,560
much any flavor of Linux you use can has many different types of compression

263
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:17,000
formats that it can extract or compress so similar thing so Windows for a long

264
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,080
time just defaults to only having zip there may be other features of

265
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:27,880
compression deeper in in the software but exposing it up front is really nice

266
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:33,000
and reduces the need for third-party programs like winrar rest in peace as

267
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,400
the as the meme goes

268
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,080
dynamic lighting for peripherals, running Windows 32 apps in isolation, Bluetooth

269
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:46,460
low-energy, and one of the most important things is ARM 32 app support will be

270
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:52,860
dropped. So they are progressing more towards ARM and you can see it. I think

271
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:58,420
they also announced that they are gonna allow for ARM virtual machines in Hyper-V.

272
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:03,420
So ARM is gonna be a big deal. Everyone knows it. I mean ARM ironically has been

273
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:08,980
around since the 70s. It came in Acorn computers I believe and the architecture

274
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,980
is designed for code generation. So when you write inside of a programming

275
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:18,380
language and you go and compile it, it generates assembly code or machine code

276
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:25,700
for the computer to run the program. Intel computers in x86 and x64

277
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:32,180
architecture have an advantage that they can fine-tune different actions of the

278
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:39,220
CPU to be faster. So you can imagine it can do stuff with artificial

279
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:43,780
intelligence, it can reduce, it has you know SIMD instructions, all these other

280
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:49,580
things that can make certain tasks much faster. And with ARM architecture the

281
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:54,540
whole concept is I think it's called RISC, reduced instruction set computing

282
00:23:54,540 --> 00:24:00,660
or CPU. I don't know what the C stands for. It's about 52 instructions I believe

283
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:07,460
and they're very set and so it's perfect for generating code because you can just

284
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:13,500
generate code simply to this machine. It's not really made for handwriting

285
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:19,460
assembly like x64 can be because it's so expressive. It's more for generated code

286
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:23,860
because there are very few actions and you repeat yourself a lot. So anyways

287
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:30,820
those are the updates on Windows 11 build. It's pretty interesting stuff.

288
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:34,380
Go check out all the changes. I'm sure some will affect you if you're on

289
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:39,260
Windows 11. I'm on Windows 11 just because new computers come with it and

290
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:46,540
so I don't like fiddling around and downgrading. I like to sometimes just be

291
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,780
on the new operating system and see how it handles. It usually gets better

292
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:54,540
security and all that sort of stuff. Usually, not always. They put more focus

293
00:24:54,540 --> 00:25:03,700
on fixing the new thing that's for sure. So that's Windows 11 and that's you know

294
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:08,460
fun stuff. I'm curious to use some of these APIs. We'll see if they how well

295
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:15,380
they integrate them or if they're just web requests. Now the I think yesterday

296
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:23,460
one of the more surprising things that popped up was this goofy handheld from

297
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:30,300
PlayStation. Now you probably have already seen this. It is not it's not it's

298
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:36,540
not a handheld like like a Steam Deck or a Switch or anything like that. So don't

299
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:42,780
get too excited. It's a streaming device. How it's different from the Wii U, how

300
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:51,020
it's different from Nvidia Shield, how is different from like that Logitech thing.

301
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:57,260
It's different because it plays PlayStation 5 exclusively as far as I

302
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:01,340
understand it. You run the game on the PlayStation 5 and it streams to the

303
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:07,860
handheld. Now that's I mean that's kind of cool. I can see the applications to it

304
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:13,860
for you know laying in bed and just having your console in the living room

305
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:20,780
or something. But you're locking down to a specific device so you have to have a

306
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:28,780
PlayStation first of all. And you you're only streaming. So this is worse than a

307
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:34,060
PlayStation PS Vita or PSP in my opinion because you can't just take games

308
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,460
with you. That's what people want to do with handhelds. They want to take games

309
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:41,820
with them. And of course you know Sony might be thinking, ah well everybody's

310
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:45,660
working from home and stop going to work these days and stop going places these

311
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:49,300
days. So you know why you even need to take games you can just stream them. I

312
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,180
don't know maybe that's their perspective. Or maybe they saw that Steam

313
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:59,220
Deck and like the Asus handheld that just came out and you know the

314
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,220
Switch were super popular and they were sitting around in their business meeting

315
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:08,980
they're like these gaming devices are getting a lot of money. Obviously people

316
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:16,540
like viewing games on screens in their hands. So that's why those devices are

317
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:20,820
selling and that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna focus tons of money on

318
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:27,260
this. I don't know how they didn't look at the basically the failure of the Wii U

319
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:33,100
and the failure of Nvidia Shield and say hmm maybe we shouldn't spend a whole

320
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:37,860
lot of money making this handheld for just our console. And like I said you can

321
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:43,500
you can make this exact device except that it'll work on Xbox and PC and

322
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:49,260
you know all those other platforms by just buying a connector for your

323
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:53,020
controller to your phone. So you could just put your phone and connect it to

324
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:57,020
your controller. Literally the same thing and way cheaper. You can buy one of those

325
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:03,980
little phone clips for like 10 bucks. So superfluous I think so. This is the main

326
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:10,780
problem with these streaming devices is that they're very niche. They really I

327
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:14,060
don't think have an audience and people. There are gonna be some people that are

328
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:21,900
hyped about it that are super like into PlayStation but yeah it's you know when

329
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:27,900
you and when you advertise 1080p 60fps that's neat. I mean that's lower

330
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:33,380
resolution than a phone and lower refresh rate than a phone normally is.

331
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:38,060
So most people have way better screens in their pockets than this will ever

332
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:42,580
hope to be and you can use that same screen to stream games on it. I don't

333
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:47,980
know. I think this was a goofy take on Sony so just wanted to bring it up. Kind

334
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:51,780
of funny. I mean it would be really cool if it was if maybe they have some kind

335
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:55,820
of update later to actually play games but I don't think so. I think this is a

336
00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:00,460
screen with controller sticks on the side but I don't know. You be the judge.

337
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:05,140
If you really like it that's I'm not saying it's bad. Go get it. You go

338
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:09,180
try to test it out. Maybe it's more it's probably more convenient to have a

339
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:13,940
separate thing for just your console. I don't know. I don't have a PlayStation 5

340
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:20,900
so yeah that's the main thing for me. I still can't play PlayStation games.

341
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:32,860
So more in the tech world news. Meta which is just Facebook is selling Jiffy.

342
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:37,420
I guess it wasn't making the money they expected to be or something like that or

343
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:40,540
or they're losing a lot of money and they need to make up some more money. I

344
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:46,260
mean it like I said in the last episode they made something like 28 billion

345
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:54,140
dollars this year so far you know in just five months. So interesting that

346
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,980
they've got to start selling off assets. Probably maybe it's to focus a little

347
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:04,020
more or something like that. I have no idea. This wasn't a huge win. They sold

348
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:07,860
Jiffy and they lost three hundred and forty seven million dollars on the deal

349
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:18,900
because they bought it for... what did they buy it for? Let's see. Okay well they

350
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:24,500
bought it for four hundred million dollars so this says in May of 2000 and

351
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:32,980
in May of 2023 so three years later they sold it for 53 million to Shutterstock.

352
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:39,340
I mean Shutterstock made a huge deal there. They got Jiffy. All they had to do

353
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:45,340
is wait and they got Jiffy for like a super discount. So I think that those

354
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:54,940
numbers are maybe a general search but it's about those numbers. So yeah it's

355
00:30:54,940 --> 00:31:00,100
interesting that tech companies will buy these with big hopes. I mean for all we

356
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:06,700
know Facebook kind of bought the service, learned the technology, cloned the

357
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:11,540
technology and then sold off the title, the name or something like that.

358
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:19,740
They very much have the assets that they needed which is probably just getting

359
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:28,100
you know the repository from Jiffy. Is it Giphy or Jiffy? I don't know.

360
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:35,300
I guess it depends on whether you're a Gif-Jiff person. So they've gotten all

361
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:39,460
the assets. They probably stored them all in the database and now can present them

362
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:47,780
themselves. So in a way they made a little bit of money back and spent less

363
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,420
money. I don't know. I don't know what these companies are doing. That's that

364
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:55,820
was just a weird interesting I guess not really that interesting but it was a

365
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:02,340
weird story about what was going what happened with with Facebook purchasing

366
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:06,860
and selling stuff. And companies buying and selling these things is nothing new.

367
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:13,180
They'll set a loss sometimes. I don't know exactly what each business decision is

368
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:18,260
but some companies will even buy other companies in order to shelve the product

369
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:22,300
because they're working on something themselves and they want they don't want

370
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:28,020
the competition. So normally they don't sell it in that scenario. So you can also

371
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:34,740
buy companies to essentially get their assets maybe get their talent their

372
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:41,300
workers their employees and you know just kind of absorb a bunch of resources

373
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:45,020
and then selling off the husks to somebody else to either do the same or

374
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:50,100
just get you know it's a benefit to whoever buys it I believe in this case.

375
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:54,340
But yeah companies do this kind of stuff all the time so it's not super

376
00:32:54,340 --> 00:33:00,780
surprising but it's interesting seeing that company get passed around

377
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:08,900
right now. Okay in the artificial intelligence realm they have they have

378
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,220
this new stuff they have new things ever like every day and there's there's

379
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:19,300
websites that are dedicated to specifically just showing you you know

380
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,860
the thousands of trained models that people have out there and the thousands

381
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:27,380
of trained AI services you can use. It's it's pretty mind-boggling how many

382
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:32,100
there are. But this one is pretty interesting I think I was talking to a

383
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:37,420
friend of mine and there are you know applications in art for this. As you

384
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:42,900
know I do some art stuff. I like to draw and animate and that sort of stuff

385
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:48,900
well time-permitting. So I'm interested in things that affect art in this way. So

386
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:54,700
researchers in this one use AI to identify similar materials on images.

387
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:59,060
That is to say they can take a video or they can take an image or a sequence of

388
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:05,420
images which is a video and be able to track parts of that image that are

389
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:10,420
similar. I don't know you know a lot of the times we don't fully understand how

390
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:14,700
the AI is operating but my guesstimate is that it bases on color and the way

391
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:19,900
the thing the things similarly like feel when they look same kind of way we see

392
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:27,180
something and and guess that it's the same material. Here's a image of it

393
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:33,260
showing isolation on these pants that this person is wearing. They're flowing

394
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:38,340
and swilling. So one of the things my friend brought up was this would be

395
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:42,660
really cool for rotoscoping. You'd be able to isolate and rotoscope your your

396
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:47,020
2d animations using this. And of course you know you're gonna have people to say

397
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:50,100
what's the point of rotoscoping when you have AI that can just generate stuff.

398
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:56,700
Look people have their own styles built in their heads whether an AI can copy

399
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:03,700
it is is irrelevant. We want to see our drawings kind of go out and and kind of

400
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:09,140
how we see things. It's not always just big corporation money-making for us

401
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:13,140
people who draw. I don't know why people think that. I mean there's a lot of

402
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:16,020
people that are really loud out there where it's all about the money but

403
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:21,420
sometimes it's not. It's just about the fun of drawing. I mean yeah anyways

404
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:28,540
that's a whole other rant aside. But this is really cool because you can like you

405
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,620
saying you can use it for say rotoscoping and one of the ideas I had

406
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:38,220
based on that was that you can use it to study. So you can take flowing movement

407
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,580
things and you can isolate them in an image very easily with this kind of

408
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:47,260
technology without having to open up you know After Effects and tracking things

409
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:51,140
and deleting the background and all that sort of stuff. You can you can actually

410
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:55,060
take just a video and then isolate it and then study the flow and the

411
00:35:55,060 --> 00:36:00,060
movement and the bounciness and how how it reacts to stuff so that you can

412
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:05,500
better animate for people who animate. Just people who draw in general study

413
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,820
but people who animate study a lot because they have to see how things move

414
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:12,940
and interact and what's the natural movement of things and all this other

415
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:18,580
sort of stuff. So it's actually pretty neat for this technology. There's a lot

416
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:24,860
of conversation on it on this on this website but you'll see that it detects

417
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:29,300
the changes. So you can see they're trying to detect the top of the matches

418
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:35,780
here and as the matches get burned it slowly whittles away and they have

419
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:42,140
it in white the focus the focus material that is similar. And so you can see it

420
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:45,500
changes over time so it's not just tracking its position obviously we saw

421
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:49,100
that with the pant legs it's actually trying to determine the material based

422
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:57,220
on the the images it's being fed. So really cool AI. If you guys ever run into

423
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:02,820
any sort of AI that could be really helpful in art just studying it and

424
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,340
having fun with it and kind of isolating things so you can try out new art

425
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:10,740
techniques let me know I really love that sort of stuff. I'm not a doom and

426
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:17,220
gloom AI person I'm in tech and I love artificial intelligence it's a neat

427
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:24,900
technology and I I like to see it as a tool more than a doomsday. So if you've

428
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,180
been having trouble getting GPUs recently I don't think you should

429
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:32,180
anymore I think the sales are coming down because all the crypto stuff. It

430
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:37,620
looks like Nvidia is losing some money on gamers right now you can pick up

431
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:43,940
cards pretty cheaply that sort of stuff but really what Nvidia is banking on and

432
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:52,660
it says it's has the same exact concept in this. I mean let's roll back

433
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:57,700
Nvidia has been pushing artificial intelligence a lot. Everybody's pushing

434
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:03,100
artificial intelligence it's the new cloud it's I mean is way bigger than the

435
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:10,060
whole cloud buzz was so it does have that it's like the new automobile or

436
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:14,820
something like that it's it's a big deal because it's it's a big deal in the

437
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,620
digital space currently because it's kind of changing all the stuff that

438
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:23,260
we've done digitally it's becoming more noisy it's filtering out noises it's

439
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,500
doing all kinds of weird stuff right now it's messing with jobs that are all

440
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:31,140
digital program from programming to art the entire spectrum anything you do on a

441
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:38,660
computer is affected by this sort of technology. So naturally Nvidia has been

442
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:46,940
focused on producing cards that optimize AI and if you don't know why GPUs are so

443
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:51,780
useful for artificial intelligence it's because GPUs have many cores you can

444
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:58,100
think of your CPU having many cores like now they have 20 or 24 but GPUs have you

445
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,900
know an order of magnitude larger than that for example you can get very easily

446
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:09,260
get a GPU that has 512 cores and you you can pay more money to get more cores and

447
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:14,140
why this is important is because these algorithms for example your brain if you

448
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:18,140
think of it as a big old matrix of neurons you just have a bunch you have

449
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:22,820
imagine you had a cube and then that cube is a bunch of little dots and those

450
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:27,180
dots connect to each other and they fire off and in order to make decisions they

451
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:32,940
kind of go through these processes of firing off and determine or not firing

452
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:38,900
firing or not firing and it's a big old grid of them so when you have a GPU that

453
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:45,060
has that exact makeup and it looks like that it's a big old grid and you can run

454
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:50,820
a little program that that essentially goes through these this grid system and

455
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:54,780
can pass information one quarter of another or can run in parallel because

456
00:39:54,780 --> 00:40:00,580
if you know CPUs you can run you can run functions in your program in parallel

457
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:04,780
which you can run up to the number of cores or the number of hyper threads

458
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:08,260
that you have on the CPU so when it comes to the GPU it's the same thing

459
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:12,300
except you got tons and tons and tons of them so GPUs are extremely good at

460
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:19,020
producing images for example because you can you can say you can take a pixel on

461
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:23,180
the screen and associate that to one of the nodes in the grid so if the more the

462
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:27,260
more of those you have the more pixels you can calculate for example in this

463
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:32,980
very simple example let's say that you know let's say that we had a hundred by

464
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:37,860
a hundred all right so you that means you could generate simultaneously on

465
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:42,340
your screen a hundred by a hundred pixels all in one call just

466
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:47,580
simultaneously so you see this is why GPUs are powerful they can run a huge

467
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:53,460
amount of similar calculations across many cores and that's very helpful for

468
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:57,700
artificial intelligence and now they have tensor cores but it all comes back

469
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:02,980
to this concept of you know stacking these cores into a grid system and all

470
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:07,020
this sort of stuff and you see this when you use APIs like tensorflow whatever

471
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:11,620
it's very similar to CUDA programming if you've ever programmed in CUDA I've done

472
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:17,220
some ray tracing stuff with it you can you can essentially define how many

473
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:21,020
cores you need and on what layout 2d layouts linear layouts all this other

474
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:28,420
stuff so Nvidia has been pushing artificial intelligence a lot so you

475
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:32,980
know some people are mocking them losing money on these graphics cards and why

476
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:36,620
are they raising the money's why are they raising the price so high look when

477
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:40,500
you're when you're a monopoly because Nvidia has a pretty strong monopoly on

478
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:46,900
artificial intelligence right now you can do that so what we're witnessing is

479
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:54,300
the birth of a monopoly so we need we need other graphics makers great

480
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:59,660
graphics cards makers which is like one of them one real one to come in and

481
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:05,860
compete otherwise we're gonna wind up in this scenario but yeah there's a there's

482
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:09,660
an article I think a PC gamer that says Nvidia doesn't care if you want if you

483
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:13,780
don't like its new graphics cards AI is going to make 11 billion dollars in just

484
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:16,620
three months and that's something I haven't even read this article I just

485
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:22,180
saw that and it made me think about it yeah I mean if you're a customer who

486
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:28,820
really likes AMD I press them in all their stuff like hey get into if you're

487
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:34,020
if you're a shareholder or anything like that say get into AI like Nvidia is just

488
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:40,980
double down on it because that's the future and and you know whatever we

489
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:46,140
learn in AI AI is gonna come to game so you know it already is it has been for a

490
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:52,740
long time I think was that that Forza that came out like years ago where it

491
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:56,620
would play as you would play online or whatever I don't know how effective it

492
00:42:56,620 --> 00:43:01,820
was but that was AI we're gonna see a lot more of that in games so it would be

493
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:06,460
in any graphics cards best interest to get into artificial intelligence and

494
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:12,980
look there's a lot of potential for making more interesting games with AI I

495
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:18,460
think it's gonna be is gonna be a really goofy period for a while and I'm all for

496
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:24,220
it I love weird goofy games where AI is gonna do weird stuff but AI already does

497
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:29,300
really weird stuff in games when it's hand-coded so making artificial

498
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,420
intelligence go in there and do it I think is is interesting because now you

499
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:37,020
can have some weird stuff you just have to figure out how to how to curate it so

500
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:43,020
it can swap between the AI and physically you know hard-coded scenarios

501
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:49,180
for say story you don't want if you're in Skyrim you don't want a main

502
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:52,980
character that you need to decide that he's having a midlife crisis and jump

503
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,380
off a cliff so otherwise you won't be able to complete the main story so

504
00:43:56,380 --> 00:44:01,220
there's gonna be some guardrails but yeah definitely AI in games is a big

505
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:05,460
thing and I think that if you're a GPU manufacturer you've got to focus on it

506
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:12,740
you can't let in the video just monopolize that space on the AI front

507
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:20,560
there is also I think if you have seen in the news somewhat recently there was

508
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:27,500
some European Union kind of legislation that they were pushing through for

509
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:32,940
specifically for open AI but for AI in general I believe it had something to do

510
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:38,060
with the transfer and collection of data same thing that Facebook was hit with a

511
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:44,580
1.3 billion dollar fine on let me see okay quick little search says that it

512
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:50,380
has to do with the aggregation of data you know that EU has a lot of strong

513
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:57,500
requirements for data collection and that sort of thing if you recall I mean

514
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:00,020
you don't even have to recall if you go to any website and you're hit with that

515
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:05,500
pop-up saying accept our cookies terms and services that was an EU thing that

516
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,580
every website does it and most of them don't even do it right they just throw

517
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:13,380
it up there and don't even it's just placebo it doesn't actually work and

518
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:17,780
there's also all kinds of plugins and tools to just delete those from the page

519
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:25,020
whenever you load them so they are quite annoying and really you should just if

520
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:28,980
you're worried about that sort of stuff you should use a browser or plugins to

521
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:34,100
stop tracking and all that but this isn't a talk about tracking or any of

522
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:44,860
that it's a talk about open AI in the EU so what open AI is saying is that you

523
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:49,020
know is they can't comply with the regulations because you know the way the

524
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:57,620
artificial intelligence has trained it's devastating for the for an artificial

525
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:02,940
intelligence that they're training to understand the internet and and

526
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:06,380
everything that's going on that has happened in history and what's going on

527
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:09,860
and that sort of stuff it's difficult to train something that is supposed to be

528
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:14,340
equivalent to a search engine because that's how for example chat GPT is being

529
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:19,220
designed it's being designed as an assistant in fact in the code you refer

530
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:23,500
to it as an assistant so it's being designed to be this thing you can

531
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,820
replace a search engine with you can query it you can ask about history you

532
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:36,740
can ask about you know news things that happen and all this sort of stuff so the

533
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:42,260
the argument is the same argument that they use for AI with art is that if you

534
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:48,100
put your art out there publicly no no watermarks or anything just for anybody

535
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:52,780
to see that the person then can kind of copy your style or even copy your image

536
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:58,100
use it to train their brain how to draw better and so AI they say the AI is just

537
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:03,860
doing the same thing this isn't an argument about whether that's moral

538
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:08,220
ethical or whatever I'm just saying that's that's the argument so the same

539
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:14,300
thing for the Internet if the documents and if people post their lives like if

540
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:19,380
somebody in Europe is posting about what they ate where they ate it at and you

541
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:25,460
know what what time of day that they did it that's on them that's their security

542
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:31,020
and privacy problem that they need to curb it's out there whether the EU likes

543
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:37,020
it or not and artificial intelligence other people stalkers you name it are

544
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:46,900
going to be consuming that information so you can't just you can't just be like

545
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:51,540
ooh AI spooky you know American technology that seems to be the theme of

546
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:57,140
the EU recently spooky American technology stealing our stuff I don't

547
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:02,420
know what their point is on this I mean all companies including European ones

548
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:07,380
are taking as much data as possible look I'm gonna say I've said it once the

549
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:12,180
1,000 times I'm gonna say it again if you put your information on the Internet

550
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:18,940
as a personal person of freedom with a freedom to do so it is your fault if

551
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:21,980
something happens it is not the company's fault it is not the

552
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:26,700
government's fault it is your fault you have put yourself in this situation now

553
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:32,860
you can complain about being educated on those kinds of things I don't think

554
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:38,380
it's the business's it's not the business's fault that you don't

555
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:46,220
understand perhaps lawmakers should probably fund classes for students

556
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:51,660
because we all have to go through schooling perhaps the government should

557
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:57,540
put their money into funding schools to educate children on privacy and data

558
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:01,780
privacy and tools that they can use and what to look out for these are all real

559
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:08,380
things once upon a time you would teach kids how to hold a bank account what is

560
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:11,900
a bank account what are investments you would teach them about all these things

561
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:15,660
that are part of our modern society that we have to deal with that's part of

562
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:20,580
schooling it's also part of the parents job so you know I'm leaving parents out

563
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:24,420
of this equation because we're specifically talking about people doing

564
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:29,900
legislation and legislatures and all this sort of stuff so it's not unheard

565
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:34,460
of to have these sorts of things in schools to teach children rather than

566
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:38,900
attacking other countries and attacking businesses and all this sort of stuff

567
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:44,940
because I'm a big believer in that if you attack the problem you're not

568
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,500
solving anything you're just causing everyone to be upset and you're just

569
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:52,700
making chaos for the reason of chaos what you need to do is find the root of

570
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:56,380
the problem where does it all come from what is the stem of it and it may be

571
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:01,540
completely unrelated to the specific problem you need to go to the root and

572
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:05,300
then solve the problem at the root that's how you solve any problem in

573
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:11,300
programming and life and legislation and anything else so it just frustrates me

574
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:17,100
that that we have these kinds of things happening and I get it I too I'm a huge

575
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:24,300
security and privacy nut I too don't want to just give my data to these

576
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:29,300
companies I don't think it's the government's job to to manhandle

577
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:33,220
companies for for this purpose and I don't think it's the company's jobs to

578
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:38,660
have a moral high ground in fact it's better for me to know that they don't so

579
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:44,500
that I am more cautious at what I do and how I control now companies should have

580
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,700
some sort of mechanism for me to completely wipe what I put up there from

581
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:53,700
their servers obviously all the other servers that scrape their servers and

582
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:57,140
copy it all have already cloned it out to the internet but at least I can

583
00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:01,780
delete it from theirs I don't know that's as one thing but yeah there's a

584
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:05,500
big stink going on I don't know what's going on and Europe like I said I love

585
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,940
my credit my cousins over there in Europe all the people are amazing and

586
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:17,020
wonderful and you know it's it's got so many charms to it but the legislation is

587
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:22,180
a little goofy just as it is everywhere in the world and the US has just as

588
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:27,340
goofy and weird legislation itself so it's not special to you but this topic

589
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:32,660
on open AI is so yeah leave our leave our robots alone

590
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:41,260
letter little robots spy on people in peace would you so that's that kind of

591
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:47,460
wraps up all the the main things that I had saved for today my last couple of

592
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:52,940
days my I'm gonna be a little sporadic these next few days I'm about to have a

593
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:58,740
child can't wait I'm super excited I'm getting prepared for that it's not my

594
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:03,580
first child so it's not gonna be any surprises or anything but there are

595
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:07,740
gonna be surprises with every baby there's always a new surprise and just

596
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:11,220
being prepared make sure I got everything ready get a room ready all

597
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:19,420
that sort of stuff yeah I just you know so within the next week I should have a

598
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:24,260
new baby I hope and if so I will probably disappear for a little bit and

599
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:29,900
up till then I'm a little sporadic anyways thanks for watching and bye for

600
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:56,980
now
