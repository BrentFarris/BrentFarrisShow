1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
Jobs for programmers. Some of us need them, some of us have them. I was curious

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,780
about remote work and how it affects the job market, what companies are doing with

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:19,960
remote work. I work remotely, a lot of you maybe work remotely, and just kind of

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,320
want to take a look at jobs. But before I get into remote work, I want to take a

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:31,080
look at losing jobs. Lots of people are losing jobs. Yet another story, today, not

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,760
today, a couple days ago Stack Overflow lays off 10% of their employees, and

7
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,760
that's not a lot. I was surprised to find out that 10% of the Stack Overflow

8
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:47,600
employee base was 58 employees, which is pretty astounding. I like that they run a

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,400
tight ship over there. I think that having, I mean, that means they've got 580

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,800
employees. I think that may be a little bit too high to run a question-and-answer

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,720
site. I don't know. I don't run a question-and-answer site. I just think

12
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,880
that oftentimes we hire too many developers. We hire way too many people,

13
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,960
and that's usually what is slowing us down at companies interworking with

14
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,480
people. So perhaps they're figuring this out and, you know,

15
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,560
laying off people. I've always said that programming is not an assembly line job.

16
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:34,400
You can't just add more programmers and then all of a sudden magically produce

17
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,320
tons more code. There's been studies of this that show that that's never the

18
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,920
case. You can look at the Mythical Man month from the 70s, and that still holds

19
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,000
true. Believe it or not, they did hire tons of programmers at companies even

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,600
back then when there weren't that many. So just taking a look at something like

21
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:02,040
that, and that information has basically held true this entire time, we can start

22
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,600
to see that you can't just hire more programmers and more developers and

23
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,400
expect things to go faster. That's just not how it works. In fact, I think the

24
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:20,080
CEO of Nintendo, he famously was shown Mother 3. I don't know which one it was.

25
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,360
Mother, the game that has like Ness as the main character. I think it's Ness. I

26
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:35,040
don't know who it is. Kid with baseball cap and the baseball bat. So it's

27
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,280
this RPG, and they presented it to him, and he said this is gonna take

28
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:48,600
forever to fix. And so he said, we can get it done in six months if we start over

29
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,880
from scratch. And that's what they did. They started over from scratch, and I

30
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,200
think it took seven or eight months to complete the game and get it published.

31
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,640
And that just shows you that sometimes having a lot of legacy code, it's easier

32
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,040
just to scrap it all and do it from scratch. And I'm a big proponent of that.

33
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:12,680
However, it's very hard to pull off in this day and age. Anyways, we have... so

34
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,840
Stack Overflow fired or laid off. I don't know. Is that any different than firing? I

35
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,920
think it's the more PC language. But they fired 58 employees, which is 10% of the

36
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:31,680
workforce. They were saying that the CEO of Stack Overflow perhaps, or his name is

37
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:39,520
I can't even pronounce his name. I'll call him PC. That's his initials.

38
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:45,600
Said that layoffs were also a result of taking a hard look at our strategic

39
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,680
priorities this fiscal year and the organizational structure. And that's

40
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,720
usually how it goes. They look and see, oh, we have a lot of bloat. We had a heyday

41
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:03,400
during that pandemic, hired people maybe for things we didn't need. And now

42
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,040
we're kind of overpopulated and slowing ourselves down, just kind of drudging

43
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,800
along. Once the ship gets bigger, it's gonna be harder to push it. So that's

44
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:23,280
essentially, you know, as vague as it is, why let it go? They want to pursue

45
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,560
agility and flexibility with the launch of AI ML focused offerings in the months

46
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,560
ahead. So everybody's going AI, obviously. I think everybody can can look around

47
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,840
and see that. Every company, I mean, most of Google I.O. is just AI. That's the

48
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,080
buzzword. That's what everybody's expecting. It's where all the investors

49
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,440
are going, even though they probably wouldn't have touched it with a 10-foot

50
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:54,760
pole like five years ago. And so Stack Overflow is in jeopardy, honestly. When

51
00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:01,400
you have a, I mean, I think I've seen articles about a dip in their user base

52
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:07,840
ever since like ChatGPT was announced and GitHub Copilot and these kinds of AI

53
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,720
generated code. And I can see why. It's very easy to just write a comment in

54
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,080
your code, say, save a file, and it detects the language and it gives you

55
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,280
basically what you would have went to Stack Overflow for, a little copy and

56
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,040
paste snippet. So I don't know exactly what they're gonna do with artificial

57
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,080
intelligence. I think the only way they can save themselves is if they compete

58
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,680
with things like Copilot and they produce an artificial intelligence that

59
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,960
takes the entire base of knowledge of Stack Overflow and all the suggestions

60
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:47,520
there and kind of works from that. Although Microsoft, you know, they bought

61
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,200
GitHub for a reason and that was to have access to all the code on GitHub,

62
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,840
whether we like it or not, to train their AIs. So they have a much bigger code base

63
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,520
to work from. So that's, you know, just nature of the business. But I

64
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:10,800
don't want to focus too much just on Stack Overflow. Ironically, and this one

65
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,040
is ironic to me because we all know about all the layoffs that are

66
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,400
happening. There's layoffs at every big company you can think of. Games, software,

67
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:29,320
nobody is safe in the software realm. And I don't want to say the funniest, but

68
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:36,000
it is kind of funny. LinkedIn cuts 700 jobs and closes their China app. So I can

69
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,160
understand why they closed their China app. I mean, that's a whole other

70
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:47,960
discussion about, you know, Chinese firewall and kind of their regulatory

71
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,880
stuff that makes it very difficult to do stuff there. So besides the point, but

72
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,520
they cut 700 jobs at LinkedIn. It's ironic because you would imagine with

73
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,080
everybody getting laid off from every big company, there's a lot of people who

74
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,760
are going to be paying for LinkedIn and trying to get jobs. So it's weird to me

75
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:17,600
that a job search website, and I have an article here that says, let's see here,

76
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:24,560
let's take a look. It says more than 197,000 tech sector employees have lost

77
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:31,200
their jobs since the start of 2023. This isn't even talking about 2022. So, you

78
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,000
know, 200,000 people looking for jobs and LinkedIn is, they're cutting, they're

79
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,840
cutting 700 jobs from their company, which does that mean people are not

80
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,720
looking for jobs? Does it mean they're not looking through LinkedIn? Or they

81
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:53,280
just, is LinkedIn just not a viable thing for finding jobs? I don't know what to

82
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,600
take of this. I've gotten jobs through LinkedIn

83
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,520
recruiters, so it's a little strange to me. I think that it's pretty effective.

84
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:08,120
There's a lot of recruiters on there and there's a lot of noise. Daily I get

85
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,360
recruiters hitting me up for jobs. I sometimes feel like I need to close down

86
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,800
my thing whenever I take a job that I'm happy with. But there's a lot of

87
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,760
recruiters and there's, it seems to be a lot of jobs because I, you know, I get them

88
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:30,920
for artificial intelligence, games, mobile apps, just the whole spectrum. So, I don't

89
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:36,400
know. So it's very odd. I don't know what to take of it. I don't know if it's a

90
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,760
good omen, a bad omen that they're cutting jobs, but something to think

91
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:49,520
about. But they're not the only ones. So, it looks like May 3rd, Unity conducts a

92
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,840
third round of layoffs. This is the Unity game engine. If you're not a game

93
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:02,040
developer, that's the one I'm talking about. They've cut something, about

94
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,920
8% of their staff, which is another 600 people getting laid off. And I guess this

95
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,080
is the third round. I have no idea what happened in the first couple of rounds.

96
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:21,080
How many people got laid off in that. So, very interesting. Again, games

97
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:27,640
are doing great right now, but I don't know if it's just the trend. All the big

98
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,240
tech bros are talking to each other at their yacht meetups or whatever rich

99
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,520
people do and saying, hey, look, we can just cut a whole bunch of jobs. Look, Elon

100
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:43,400
Musk did it. He cut Twitter to nothing. And still the thing is running and

101
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:48,520
tons of people are using it and it hasn't totally collapsed. Maybe we

102
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:56,360
can do the same. I don't know. But usually, once one person does it, it really

103
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,960
starts a chain reaction. They all realize, hey, maybe we're bloated. We need to save

104
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:05,320
some money. Inflation is happening. All kinds of weird stuff's happening.

105
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,640
Banks are collapsing. Maybe we should start cutting people to save money. I

106
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:15,440
don't know. But it's very interesting. It's affecting everybody from

107
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,200
games to software to tech companies. The whole spectrum. Even LinkedIn. If

108
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,040
LinkedIn's being hit, then you know everything's being hit. That's the way I

109
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:38,640
see it. I did see something from Times Now News. Amid mass layoffs,

110
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,800
there's a particular IT company, an Indian IT company, that is hiring like

111
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:53,120
1,500 people. That's not unheard of. I actually was fired. I will call it fired,

112
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:59,840
laid off, whatever you want to call it. I was laid off. I was part of a

113
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,400
studio, a game studio, and we were making money. The company was already bought

114
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,840
once and they were about to be bought again. They decided to lean up.

115
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:15,240
What they did was they brought in a bunch of... I don't know if they were... I never

116
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:22,080
asked them. I think they were Russian. They may have been Ukrainian. The guy

117
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,000
that was kind of communicating with them and working with them, he was Russian, so

118
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,120
I don't know what the people on the other end was. They didn't really explain

119
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,120
it much. But after working with them and they got integrated with the team, they

120
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,600
laid off everybody in the United States for that company and offshored

121
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:48,120
everything. So it makes perfect sense that they'd be offshoring. Offshore

122
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:55,480
companies would be hiring tons and tons of new people. That could be

123
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:01,880
exactly what it is. I think that's gonna be unnecessary with all

124
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:07,800
the AI stuff that we're creating because it can do it much more efficiently and

125
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:13,200
you can have one programmer who's a little more effective maybe. He's got

126
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,720
a no code. You can't just hire anybody to just put in prompts for

127
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,480
AI. You've got to have somebody who knows code inside and out. So I guess the

128
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:29,280
upper echelons of coders, your jobs are safe. So don't worry about that. So

129
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:40,600
there's been a lot of layoffs. Intel did more layoffs on May 9th, it looks like. So

130
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:47,640
you've got Intel and Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and just tons of companies

131
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,760
just even this month laying off people. And I think that we're tired of seeing

132
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:58,360
all the headlines because we've seen them basically every month for like a

133
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,000
year but it's still going and that's that's pretty crazy.

134
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,680
Luckily I've not had any problems with this since way back when

135
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,040
and that scenario I was talking about. But it is unfortunate for a lot of

136
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:19,280
people. I don't know how to deal with job security there when you're in a huge

137
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:24,800
company like these some of these big companies, Intel, Microsoft. They'll

138
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,160
probably cut important people not even knowing. They just need

139
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:37,640
big sections to just disappear so that they can kind of reserve their funds.

140
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:42,680
So that's kind of the crazy stuff that's going on and the job stuff. I'm

141
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:48,880
not worried at all. If you're secure in your job you don't have to worry. If

142
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,840
you're a really good programmer and you know many languages and you can go

143
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:57,680
cross-discipline you really don't have to worry. You're gonna be fine.

144
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,640
And if you do get laid off like I said I get tons of stuff in LinkedIn. I

145
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,840
know there's stuff out there for you. So if you are laid off, if you're not,

146
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:14,680
something to think about. Everything's good. That brings us to remote work. So I

147
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:39,240
started thinking about remote work today because...



148
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,940
Elon Musk did a long interview and one of the things that came up with that was remote

149
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,140
work.

150
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:50,260
You probably know Elon's point of view on remote work.

151
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:55,740
And you know, I'm somewhat ambivalent to remote work.

152
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:03,900
I think that it has its benefits for those of us like me who have family in a place that's

153
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:12,460
not so techie and it has its huge downsides which we'll also kind of cover.

154
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:19,580
So kind of what he went over today was he opposes the work from home policies and called

155
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,700
out remote work and said it was morally wrong.

156
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:28,740
He suggested that work from home policies are fundamentally unfair since every employee

157
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:36,140
can work from home, pointing to a factory and food workers.

158
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:44,460
So basically what he's saying is there are kind of, I don't know if you want to call

159
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:50,400
them elites, who can work from home, people like me, who have a job that pretty much is

160
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,120
all done on the web.

161
00:15:52,120 --> 00:16:00,320
And then you have the other part of the society who are equally important in holding up the

162
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:06,380
society and producing food and working in factories and keeping everything we enjoy

163
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,160
afloat.

164
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:14,080
And there is an unfairness to that and it could cause social tension, I think, is his

165
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,580
perspective on this.

166
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:24,780
He mentioned Amazon and Apple want their employees to go back to office, which is true.

167
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:31,720
Game companies like Blizzard and Microsoft want that as well.

168
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,360
And it's kind of a big push to get back to office.

169
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,360
For employees, the remote work benefits are obvious.

170
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,800
And that's kind of what was said.

171
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,880
That's like a quick summary of what was said in that.

172
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:57,840
Now my perspective on remote work, I know that I have a bias, but I also understand

173
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,080
this point of view.

174
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,040
I understand the unfairness factor to society.

175
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:11,000
Of course, there's always been a disparity between, say, programmers who sit and don't

176
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,560
have to do much.

177
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:18,640
We're not lifting heavy weights or heavy things and risking our lives like other people are

178
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,800
doing.

179
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,200
And then other people do that.

180
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,840
And somehow programmers get paid more.

181
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:31,960
And it all comes down to capitalism, supply and demand.

182
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,960
For example, if computers just died today, I'd probably be able to pick up and learn

183
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,040
construction or something like that as long as I'm mobile and able.

184
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,960
And that's not so easy.

185
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,240
If all the lumber in the world disappeared and all we had were computers, it would be

186
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,440
much more difficult for someone in construction to take a role that I work in.

187
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,360
And that's not to say one is harder than the other or anything like that.

188
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,320
That's just how capitalism works.

189
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,760
It's a supply and demand scenario.

190
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:09,640
And it can be unfair, but it's created the greatest nation in the world and the greatest

191
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:15,120
prosperity that the world has ever seen because we do share a lot of our prosperity.

192
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,400
So it's unfortunate.

193
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,000
I have no solution.

194
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,360
I have no opinion on a solution.

195
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,360
I'm just a family man who wants to feed his kids.

196
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:33,840
So from the perspective of working from home, I've worked with a lot of people who work

197
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,720
from home for the last couple of years.

198
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:45,000
I mean, my job all the way up till 2020 was going to the office and I would take a train

199
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,800
two hours to get there and two hours back because I wanted to live in a different place

200
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:54,380
than the job was or it was way too expensive to live where the job was.

201
00:18:54,380 --> 00:19:00,520
So I sacrificed four hours of my day, five days a week just to get to and from work.

202
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:09,120
And I was on trains where people on the train before me were attacked by people with machetes.

203
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,560
And I've seen quite a few weird things on the train.

204
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:19,180
So I prefer not to do that, especially now that I have children.

205
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:28,320
So there is like a rah-rah and a lot of people who are remote work, working from home, they

206
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,160
have this like, let's band together and not allow it to happen.

207
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,320
Now I would like to say if you could make yourself valuable.

208
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,720
Now this is the same thing between programmers.

209
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:45,080
So you have a value hierarchy of supply and demand within programmers.

210
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:53,640
You have programmers who there's a lot of supply and the demand is met.

211
00:19:53,640 --> 00:20:00,480
But then you have jobs that are much higher difficulty that have a very low supply of

212
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,160
programmers and has a very high demand.

213
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:12,640
Now I would argue that if there's a huge supply of programmers for a particular job, then

214
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,600
a company may be in their rights to say, come into work.

215
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,980
And that's because you don't really have arguing power there.

216
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,720
You don't, you can't fight for your position.

217
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,980
You can't do something like that.

218
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:31,760
Now programmers who are in much lower supply, let's say they're a systems programmer, game

219
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:38,340
engine programmers, those sorts of people, you have bargaining power.

220
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,880
It's hard to find people in that realm.

221
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,440
And you could say, hey, I'll take a little bit of a pay cut.

222
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,480
Let me work exclusively from home.

223
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,280
And we've got a deal.

224
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,120
And companies would gladly do that.

225
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:58,360
And they even before the whole pandemic, people would have, companies would have gladly done

226
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,360
it.

227
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,700
I've worked with people who worked remote.

228
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:10,560
So I think just on the perspective of remote work, there is, you know, you don't have a

229
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,640
right to just want to do it your way.

230
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,360
And the reason I say this is because I've worked with a lot of programmers who work

231
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,280
remote who don't do much of anything.

232
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:25,040
They, I know they came in late, came in late.

233
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,040
They push off things.

234
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,960
They go to a lot of meetings and just work doesn't get done.

235
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,200
And you can tell because timelines get pushed all the time.

236
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,920
And part of that is the hierarchy of the business, you know, management and all that stuff and

237
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,320
having too many programmers.

238
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:48,000
And that's a whole other thing to, to, to look at.

239
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,560
Now one thing I will say is I do miss working in person.

240
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,120
It is something that I do miss.

241
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,520
I actually liked going in and the camaraderie and, you know, making the jokes and eating

242
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:05,320
with the, eating with the coworkers and talking about code and projects and concepts and ideas

243
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,800
and game designs and hunting and just random stuff.

244
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
I do miss that.

245
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,040
And, you know, the free lunches were awesome too.

246
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,080
You get free lunch every day.

247
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,600
Those, those were great, a great incentive.

248
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,600
So there were definitely huge perks that I really miss.

249
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,420
Now as a father, I love being at home with my kids.

250
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,920
So working remote is a dream come true.

251
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:37,200
I, the time that I would spend traveling to go to work to come from work can be spent

252
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,960
with my children.

253
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,440
And really there's, that's, there's no, there's nothing that compares.

254
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,760
It's it's the dream.

255
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:52,120
So though I do miss the social aspect of talking to people and that does, you know, is a downside.

256
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,160
There is an upside to being with my family.

257
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,760
You gotta pay somewhere.

258
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,480
You can't get everything for free.

259
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:05,840
Now people who don't have families, I'm sorry, but you know, I would even encourage you to

260
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,840
go to work.

261
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,500
Staying at home all day is not good for your mental health.

262
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:14,360
If you don't have families, even if you just have a wife and you don't have kids, it's

263
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,240
not good for you just to be at home all day, locked in a room, same room every day, nobody

264
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,680
around you.

265
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,080
That's that's not healthy.

266
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:28,520
And I would say try maybe, you know, going into work when they have those, uh, they have,

267
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,800
uh, pretty much every job has open desks for you to go in and work.

268
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,280
The problem there is if nobody else is there, then you're just in a bigger room alone and

269
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,040
you had to travel to get there.

270
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:44,920
So there is kind of an incentive in that way for companies to request people to come into

271
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:50,740
work so that people can see each other so that it gives incentive to people who want

272
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:54,700
to come in, maybe not all the time to come in.

273
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,160
It's a very difficult situation.

274
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,560
I understand the perspective as a work from home person who does not want to change it

275
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,400
because I have children.

276
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,160
I will say though, if I didn't have children, I'd be going back to work.

277
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,640
I would actually be going in.

278
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,200
I would probably get a different job that was closer to me.

279
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:17,000
So I didn't spend four hours traveling, but I would likely go into work, uh, because I

280
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:24,160
just, I love that social atmosphere of being with like-minded people working together,

281
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,160
that sort of thing.

282
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,280
It's, I just miss it.

283
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,440
So really the only reason I don't is my kids.

284
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:35,660
So that's, that's kind of the two sides of the coin.

285
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:41,200
I feel the upsides, like I said previously of working from home for, even for people

286
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,240
without kids are obvious, uh, lower cost of living.

287
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:54,720
For example, I lived in a high cost area and in 2020 I moved back to be with family and

288
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,760
just my entire, you know, extended family, uh, were really close.

289
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:06,880
So by doing that, my cost of living went way down and that was a huge benefit to me and

290
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,800
made it much more comfortable to raise my children.

291
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,600
Um, and to know that I could provide for them a home and everything else.

292
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:21,720
So there's just so many benefits from working from home.

293
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:29,920
Um, but I do get it and employees are not as productive as they could be in office.

294
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:35,640
This is why, if you remember before 2020, um, we work was booming.

295
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,440
I think it's dead now because of everything that happened, but it was booming because

296
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:47,400
people would leave home to rent a space in an office, even if it was by themselves, if

297
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:52,560
they're video editors or whatever, just because they made them more productive or maybe it

298
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,720
made them feel more productive.

299
00:25:53,720 --> 00:26:00,320
I don't know, but I think going to have a space to work at, especially with others does

300
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,720
make you more productive in general.

301
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,080
It's a lot easier to talk to people.

302
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:10,000
Now at my last company, what we did is we had a discord channel and we had a, uh, kind

303
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,480
of a structure that segmented the programmers into five groups.

304
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,040
And my group would be in discord all day long and we had pushed to talk.

305
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,520
So we'd press a button and talk.

306
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,040
And it was kind of like being in the office because there was a lot of banter.

307
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,480
We made some jokes.

308
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,560
We made, you know, as, as employer, as employees do with each other, made inappropriate jokes,

309
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,800
made, uh, just, just had, you know, shooting the breeze and having a lot of fun.

310
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,620
But we also did of course, use that to talk about random problems.

311
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:45,640
So there wasn't a meeting barrier, uh, where we'd have to set up a meeting to talk about

312
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,640
something.

313
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,520
We just press a button and say, Hey, yo, you know, I have this problem.

314
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,680
You guys seen it, you guys know what's going on.

315
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,680
And they would just respond.

316
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,520
It was very simple.

317
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,240
Uh, also meetings, I think exploded.

318
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,160
I don't even want to get into meetings.

319
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,440
Anyone who has a job in programming knows meetings are useless.

320
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,540
Uh, I think it's just a pad the hours of the day and people, uh, they say, oh, I hate meetings

321
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:14,320
but then the, they make the meetings go really long because they don't want to get back to

322
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,320
work.

323
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,080
Uh, you know, get back to work.

324
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:23,920
Uh, they want to be able to go into the standup the next day and say, oh, you know, I had

325
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,600
meetings for this and that and that and this other meeting and, you know, meetings all

326
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,600
day.

327
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,320
So it was really hard to get anything done.

328
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,160
Um, that's, that's common.

329
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,280
It's not as common as my current job.

330
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,800
My last job, super common.

331
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:44,880
Their job I think is a lot more, um, streamlined and they're, they're pretty effective at kind

332
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,000
of managing those meetings, at least for me, others maybe not, but at least for me and

333
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,380
the one I work at has tons of remote workers.

334
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,000
They hire tons of people knowing they're out of state.

335
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:02,160
Even, uh, I'm out of state and you know, everybody on my, on the engine team is out of state

336
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,160
from the actual office.

337
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:10,160
So I think they've just, they're much more educated and well-versed in how to work with,

338
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:15,180
uh, work with remote people, manage the time and get things done.

339
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:18,160
So it is kind of up to the business.

340
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,240
If it's a big business, it's hard to do that.

341
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,240
So at big businesses, you're going to see big businesses calling people in the, at the

342
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:30,640
more medium sized ones, uh, you know, or sub studios, you're probably going to see a lot

343
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,200
more remote work.

344
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:37,440
So that's my long rant on remote work.

345
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:45,400
And like I said, it has emotional health, uh, benefits and negatives.

346
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,320
I think there's a lot of benefits for families, people with children.

347
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:54,440
I think that there's a lot of negatives for people who are just, you know, I don't want

348
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:59,080
to say alone, but you know, they, they're not married or they don't have kids.

349
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,480
Maybe their spouse goes somewhere else to work or their spouse is just in another room

350
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,480
all day.

351
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,360
I can see there being some, you know, severe downsides.

352
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,360
People are social.

353
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,360
We want to talk.

354
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:15,720
Um, you know, I talked to my son who can't really make a full, he can't even make a full

355
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,440
sentence, but there's a lot of social to that.

356
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,880
And I play with him and you know, it it's, I think I fill my social meter if we're talking

357
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,280
about the Sims, uh, pretty effectively with that.

358
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:31,680
So yeah, that's, that's kind of the perspective on remote work.

359
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,880
If you're a remote worker, get on a good for you.

360
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:41,720
But um, you know, I'm, I'm not into the whole rah, rah, let's rally together and never let

361
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:46,840
a, never let them make us, uh, come into the office ever again.

362
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:52,920
I think that there are huge benefits to be in the office, um, and a lot of scenarios

363
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:58,760
and a, you got to choose your battles and you've got to have the skills that are worth,

364
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,880
uh, worth it to the company to argue for remote work in my opinion.

365
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:23,880
So that's, that's the perspective on remote work.



366
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:31,560
Alright, due to there not being a whole lot of news today I suppose, everybody is talking

367
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:38,040
about Sega raising its price to $70 for games.

368
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:45,320
Now I have heard the argument, games have been the same price for many many years.

369
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,440
Uh huh, I hear ya.

370
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:55,320
I mean it has raised $10 once before and $10 again, I hear that argument.

371
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:01,880
It would be a valid argument if all the methods of distribution were exactly the same.

372
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,160
The difference is that all the methods of distribution have changed.

373
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,800
A lot of people buy digital.

374
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,920
I would probably think that most people buy digital.

375
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:22,880
Just look at Steam sales and those digital sales still being full box price is crazy

376
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,880
to me.

377
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,640
It's crazy that the price is so high.

378
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:30,440
It's crazy that we're going to $70, we're going to be at like $100 soon.

379
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:38,760
I get that there's inflation and the whole economy thing that's going haywire, but still

380
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:45,200
the $70 for a game, that's a lot of money for people.

381
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:52,600
You can imagine everybody from kids who just started working, who left their parents' house,

382
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:58,200
maybe they're starting their career and they're starting to work and develop their skills,

383
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,720
they want to go home and play games too.

384
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:07,120
You're kind of limiting them to buying one game a year or something like that.

385
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,880
You can't buy that many AAA games at $70 a pop in those scenarios.

386
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:18,880
I know because I had a minimum wage job to start and I couldn't even buy ice cream.

387
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:25,200
So in that scenario I'd have to save $70 somehow because I had rent and everything else to

388
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,840
pay so I wouldn't even be able to buy AAA games.

389
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,280
I've got to wait until they go on sale.

390
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:35,040
But then you have companies like Nintendo that just don't go on sale for whatever reason.

391
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:40,280
And since they never go on sale and they keep their games at their top price, even when

392
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:46,360
you want to buy used, you're paying like $52.

393
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,360
That's insane.

394
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:52,880
How are you going to play any of these games you really want to play in that perspective?

395
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,080
It's unheard of.

396
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,560
So raising it to $70, that's a $10 jump.

397
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,080
You have digital distribution.

398
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:07,680
It does not cost you the same that it would cost you to put a box on the shelf of a store

399
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,560
because you have to make all that box art, you have to produce it, you have to publish

400
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:17,360
it, you have to work with the warehouses and shipping and distribution and overseas shipping

401
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,580
and all of that sort of stuff.

402
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,640
You don't have to do that anymore.

403
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,960
You just click a button and download it.

404
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,880
And server space is cheap, man.

405
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,640
So many cloud providers competing in the space, it's cheap.

406
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,640
They're cheap.

407
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,840
Especially when you buy it at scale, it's incredibly cheap.

408
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:47,600
So going up to $70 for games, I feel like it's a real shame because I remember myself

409
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,160
in that scenario and this would have just made it so I couldn't play any games at all.

410
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:59,080
I'd have to play like the throwaway sports games that everybody has.

411
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,640
As a game collector, and if any of you collect games, you know exactly what I'm talking about,

412
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,200
the wall of sports games would be like all you could afford.

413
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:15,800
So I think another problem why the prices have gone up is the same thing with the companies.

414
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,680
They overstaff.

415
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,080
They over budget.

416
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:26,120
They spend way too much time managing and meetings and planning and JIRA and tasks and

417
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,960
all this sort of nonsense.

418
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:37,440
They waste so much money and hire way too many people to make a video game.

419
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,840
I can't compare games now to games from the 90s where you had like five dudes working

420
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:46,720
on it at Nintendo and they'd produce a hit title.

421
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,880
Of course, games are way more complicated now.

422
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,720
There's way more to them and there's a lot of higher expectations.

423
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,320
I get that.

424
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:02,300
But at the same time, back then they had to make their own tools to make it work.

425
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:08,440
Now you've got Unity, you've got Unreal Engine, you can do motion capture with pretty cheap

426
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,440
equipment now.

427
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,240
It's super cheap to do motion capture, to set up a motion capture studio.

428
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:21,560
Studios that work that just have one and just to have one or whenever they need it.

429
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,880
It's really inexpensive nowadays.

430
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,160
We're not talking like 50 grand to set up a mocap studio.

431
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:36,840
People can set up mocap with, I remember like six or almost, yeah, six or ten years ago,

432
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:44,440
somewhere in there, people were getting a whole bunch of, what are they called, the

433
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,440
Microsoft Kinect.

434
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,960
They're getting a whole bunch of those and you get like three or five of them and you

435
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,800
connect them together.

436
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:56,240
And you had a mocap basically that you sure had to clean up, but what mocap don't you

437
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,080
have to clean up?

438
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,800
And it's way cheaper now.

439
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,680
So it's way cheaper to produce.

440
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,400
You have all these tools made for you.

441
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:10,320
You don't need crazy, you don't need an army of engine programmers.

442
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:16,200
You just kind of, you know, you need game programmers and they use the tools that pre-exist

443
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,840
in the engine.

444
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,080
You have tons of tools from online.

445
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:26,200
You've got all the third party tools like Blender is free even.

446
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:32,200
You have Affinity or Adobe Photoshop and all that sort of stuff.

447
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,800
And you have AI now.

448
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,000
You have libraries of PBR materials.

449
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,640
Just so much stuff to accelerate your process.

450
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:48,760
Being in games, at least in the last company, it took us way too many years to develop a

451
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,800
game and that's because we remade it multiple times because it wasn't feeling right.

452
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,980
It wasn't hitting the KPIs.

453
00:36:54,980 --> 00:37:01,080
So in that part, it's kind of your problem, the business problem to figure out.

454
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,760
And maybe with less people, you would have a more clear direction.

455
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:10,880
So $70 for a game, man, that's a tough bullet to bite, especially for me.

456
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,960
I can tell you right now, I have children.

457
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,040
I'm not going to be spending $70 on a game.

458
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:23,680
I will wait until that game goes on sale at my local game stores and I will buy it much

459
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,320
cheaper or I'll buy it on eBay.

460
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:30,260
I will not buy top dollar, $70 games.

461
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:34,520
Like the Legend of Zelda is out right now and I really want to play it.

462
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,160
First of all, I'm about to have a kid, so I can't.

463
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:44,120
But even so, I would much rather just wait some number of months to get it at a reasonable

464
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,120
price.

465
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,520
$70 is way too much.

466
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:53,680
That's like how much money I spend at the grocery store buying like five things.

467
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,040
So would I rather eat or would I rather play a game?

468
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,040
I'm going to choose to eat, sorry.

469
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:12,480
So hopefully people fight this and they just, I don't know, stop buying $70 games or just

470
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,520
only buy games on sales or third party because that's crazy.

471
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,760
That's crazy towns.

472
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,240
But companies Activision, Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Take-Two Interactive, which owns a lot

473
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:32,600
of companies by the way, PlayStation, Xbox, and even Nintendo have all raised their prices

474
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:40,080
and so and Sega now have all raised their prices to $70 and it's a shame.

475
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,320
That's my opinions on that.

476
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,160
If you have a strong opinion on it, let me know.

477
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:49,200
Maybe a counter argument and let me know why we should be paying $70 rather than companies

478
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:55,280
kind of fixing their staffing problem and all their other problems to reduce the cost

479
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,360
for them so that they can pass those savings on to the consumer.

480
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,760
That's my thoughts on that.

481
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:08,740
All right, so I'm going to wrap this up with a couple of shorter things.

482
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:13,520
So one is the Nintendo 64 controller for the Switch is now available.

483
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,160
I mention this because I missed out on it last time it sold out.

484
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,160
I missed out on the Super Nintendo controller and I bought both of those just now.

485
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:32,120
So I do want to play the emulator games on the Switch using the controllers I remember

486
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,320
from my childhood.

487
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:37,200
So that's going to be exciting.

488
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,220
If they're still in stock by the time this goes up tomorrow, tomorrow morning, hopefully

489
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:47,200
you can grab one if you also missed it.

490
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:55,760
And another topic that is near and dear to my heart is that Overwatch has canceled their

491
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,320
PvE hero mode.

492
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,720
And that sucks.

493
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,800
I mean, I'm pretty sure that's going to make tons of people angry.

494
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,680
Now, I haven't played Overwatch in some number of months now.

495
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,040
I was an avid player.

496
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,960
I've played it ever since it launched.

497
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,060
I have an Overwatch 2 poster that's signed by the developers because I loved playing

498
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:23,800
it so much, even with all its quirks and its biases and its angry players and all of those

499
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,720
sorts of things.

500
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,720
I loved Overwatch.

501
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,720
I loved the characters.

502
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,640
Didn't care much about the stories that they put out.

503
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,280
I'm not super into stories for games.

504
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:42,980
I also don't like it when they retcon a whole bunch of stuff just to please people.

505
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:46,200
So I just didn't pay attention to the story, but the gameplay was awesome.

506
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:51,440
The character, like the way the different characters would play, it was just a lot of

507
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,440
fun.

508
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,560
It was fun to play the characters.

509
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,760
Their character controllers were awesome.

510
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:02,520
Their networking, for some of its flaws, was pretty dang good, or is pretty dang good.

511
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:09,040
So I was super hyped about the PvE mode for Overwatch.

512
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,880
I don't know who else was.

513
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:19,960
I've played so much competitive matches and arcade modes that I was ready for a PvE mode,

514
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:25,840
something where you can have a character, you can essentially level them up, play with

515
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,280
other people, play with friends, randos, doesn't matter.

516
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:33,080
I thought it would be a lot less toxic.

517
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,720
If you've ever played competitive or any other part of Overwatch, you know it's crazy toxic.

518
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,800
You can be getting along with somebody just fine, one mistake and it's over.

519
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,800
They're just pissed.

520
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,160
They're just going to yell at you and they're going to scream and they're going to say,

521
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,840
it's all, I don't know, choose a character.

522
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,440
They're going to blame somebody.

523
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,640
They always blame somebody else, somebody but themselves.

524
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:01,400
Being a team game, if you're not being a team player, it's probably you.

525
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:08,160
But I don't know, the matches where you clicked with people and you had fun, and even if they

526
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,720
were close matches and you lost or whatever and people were still cool about it, that's

527
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,200
what I liked and it felt really good with that.

528
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,280
And I thought the PvE would be that.

529
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:24,120
I thought it would be that experience that I enjoyed so much from the online play, playing

530
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:32,360
with people who just were having fun and could cooperate and were just enjoying the game

531
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:36,160
and nobody was being toxic.

532
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,360
I thought that was going to be just amazing.

533
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:44,840
So they scrapped that and of course that probably means I won't play anytime soon anymore.

534
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:49,400
Like I said, I haven't been playing for a few months, but if they said, oh, PvE is launching

535
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:58,320
in a month, I would be right back into Overwatch, getting prepared after my new kid is born.

536
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:09,320
And man, that would have brought me back so fast, but man, it's just, I'm so disappointed.

537
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,440
That's the hard part is that I'm not angry.

538
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:17,840
I'm just disappointed because the game was great and I thought this would be so awesome.

539
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:21,720
You know, with all the team swapping and stuff they did internally at Blizzard, I can see

540
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,640
how these kinds of things happen.

541
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:29,320
Being on teams of programmers and game developers who've had that sort of thing happen in the

542
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,400
past, I get it.

543
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,400
Totally get it.

544
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,680
The developers themselves are probably super disappointed.

545
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,200
At the end of the day, it's a business, they've got to make money.

546
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,720
And the live services is what makes their money.

547
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:47,680
So super disappointed in that.

548
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,580
So that's a random topic on games.

549
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:53,960
And now to throw out something for the programmers.

550
00:43:53,960 --> 00:44:00,760
This is going to be for the much more advanced programmers, for those of you who are interested

551
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:06,920
in multi-threaded applications and verifying your code.

552
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:17,400
If you haven't used, I guess it's a language, it's a logic checker, it's called TLA+, it's

553
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,160
been around for quite a while.

554
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,440
I'm a huge fan of the guy who made it.

555
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,080
Just him personally.

556
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:29,880
I can't remember his name off the top of my head.

557
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,480
I'm going to have to look it up.

558
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:37,480
But he works on algorithms.

559
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,560
He's a mathematician in the background.

560
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:45,360
Let's see, who made TLA+.

561
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,840
So he comes from this algorithms background.

562
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:59,680
And his focus was primarily on multi-threaded applications or intercommunication between

563
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,520
computers, parallel computing.

564
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,760
Leslie Lamport, how could I forget?

565
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,860
LL.

566
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:10,640
So TLA is a way for you to check your multi-threaded code.

567
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:16,080
I think it's kind of the root, his favorite algorithm that he came up with, the root of

568
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,320
it goes back to the bakery algorithm.

569
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,600
And I'll leave that to you to look up.

570
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,640
It basically has to do with a man going into the bakery and getting a ticket.

571
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,400
And there's a bunch of people with tickets and it's like a multi-threading program.

572
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,360
And it's an algorithm to solve that problem.

573
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:37,560
But TLA+, if you haven't used it, you should use it.

574
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,040
There's a funny story about it.

575
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:44,840
He works at Microsoft and Microsoft didn't start using it internally, rigorously until

576
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:51,600
Amazon published that they were using it and was making their web services so much better.

577
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:57,160
And if you're doing web stuff, if you're doing multi-threaded programming, check out TLA+.

578
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:02,460
It does use logic notation from mathematics.

579
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,840
It's in ASCII form.

580
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:09,040
So if you're going to do like an and or or, you've got to use the forward slash, back

581
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:14,060
slash to make the shape to do the logic.

582
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:17,840
But learning logic notation is not that complicated.

583
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,920
Just look it up on Wikipedia.

584
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,400
It's a pretty short read.

585
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:27,080
And I would highly suggest if you haven't used TLA+, this is a PSA, you don't see a

586
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,080
whole lot on it.

587
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,880
I would like you to check it out.

588
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:39,400
And I'll put the link to an article that I saw recently that got me thinking about it

589
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:43,160
that kind of talks about the two-phase pizza party.

590
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:48,800
And there's a step, I think it explains, I haven't read through the whole thing, but

591
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:54,440
it looks like it explains TLA+, in a basic way, to learn it.

592
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,080
So I'm going to be posting that in the description.

593
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:01,480
I'll put it on the Twitter, and go check it out if you're into multithreaded stuff, if

594
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,720
you're learning multithreaded stuff, if you do web things, check it out.

595
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:11,920
It's going to make your algorithms better, and it's going to help you a lot in solving

596
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,080
problems before they happen.

597
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:18,720
Lots of problems happen with concurrency on the web, and this is a great way to solve

598
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,880
that.

599
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,440
So that's it for today.

600
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,600
I know it was a lot of rant about jobs, but there's been a lot of things going on about

601
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,600
it.

602
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,440
There was that interview with Elon Musk, it really got me thinking about it.

603
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,880
And those are my perspectives on that.

604
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,800
I'd like to hear your perspectives, if you have any, how you feel.

605
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:41,040
I'm sure most of you have been doing remote work as developers, and I want to know what

606
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:47,400
you think, maybe from the perspective of somebody who doesn't have children, and how you feel

607
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,680
about that.

608
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:53,400
Because I remember I started remote work without children, and I thought it was the most incredible

609
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:58,040
thing in the world, but I don't know what it would be like a few years into it, and

610
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:02,200
still being, you know, not flying solo.

611
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:06,280
You may have had a girlfriend or wife or whatever, but kind of that aspect of it.

612
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:09,560
I'm really curious on your perspective on that, so let me know.

613
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:24,840
Anyways, have a good one, and bye for now.
