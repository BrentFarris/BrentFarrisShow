0:00:00.000,0:00:06.500
Welcome back today. We've got a few news stories. We're gonna talk about Google Chrome both with misspelled URLs

0:00:07.020,0:00:09.020
Third-party cookies, we're gonna talk about

0:00:09.740,0:00:14.600
How you shouldn't feel so bad about not finishing projects. I'm gonna talk about augmented reality

0:00:14.600,0:00:21.340
I love augmented reality chat GPT has an iOS app dotnet for previews here and just general

0:00:21.740,0:00:26.800
Just general tech stuff. It's gonna be exciting. Hopefully I can sync up my audio right this time

0:00:26.800,0:00:31.080
I think I've had some issues in the past, but we shall see

0:00:32.360,0:00:37.680
Chat GPT it's out on iOS. I don't know if you heard about it. Everybody's talking about it

0:00:37.680,0:00:44.760
There's tons of people tweeting about it and articles being made. It's this big old hubbub. I don't have an iPhone

0:00:45.480,0:00:47.480
it's not on Android and

0:00:48.360,0:00:49.740
well

0:00:49.740,0:00:51.160
My wife has an iPhone

0:00:51.160,0:00:57.900
So for those of you who don't have an iPhone and have an Android like me or just not even a smartphone at all

0:00:57.900,0:01:00.500
Maybe you have a dumb phone or Linux phone. Who knows?

0:01:01.680,0:01:04.680
I'm gonna spoil it for you. You launch the app

0:01:05.080,0:01:11.600
It asks you for your date of birth and then it asks you for your phone number

0:01:12.000,0:01:18.240
Now the date of birth thing might be some requirement by Apple for artificial intelligence stuff the blah blah blah blah

0:01:18.240,0:01:25.720
The phone number thing is annoying. I already have a an account with with open AI

0:01:25.720,0:01:30.200
I use their API is for just random toy projects of my own

0:01:30.880,0:01:32.880
nothing nothing public

0:01:33.360,0:01:35.320
but

0:01:35.320,0:01:37.320
the iOS version of chat GPT is

0:01:37.960,0:01:40.480
It's basically just the web version except

0:01:41.160,0:01:47.440
Harder to use I think and that's the easiest way to explain it. I guess it's in your pocket and it's on your phone

0:01:47.440,0:01:52.680
So it's easier for people who don't have desktops or laptops or anything. That's of that nature

0:01:54.280,0:01:56.160
There is a

0:01:56.160,0:02:01.120
Voice input button you press that and a big old voice thing pops up. It's not a Siri

0:02:01.560,0:02:05.640
It's just a big old voice thing. It's probably their whisper or whatever

0:02:06.240,0:02:08.640
Whatever their API is called for

0:02:09.280,0:02:11.000
voice to text

0:02:11.000,0:02:14.600
So you press that you talk into it you press it again

0:02:14.600,0:02:19.040
The the big old circle that it makes and it just puts the text in the input box

0:02:19.720,0:02:25.520
Doesn't even send it so I don't see the difference between typing with voice to text normally with Siri

0:02:26.320,0:02:30.920
Versus pressing that other than that one. Maybe is more accurate. I don't know

0:02:31.920,0:02:33.920
I didn't exactly

0:02:35.680,0:02:37.680
Overtest this thing so I checked that out

0:02:37.800,0:02:42.040
That was underwhelming and then you can normally type in text and then it'll respond

0:02:42.040,0:02:45.640
It does respond pretty quick. She

0:02:46.120,0:02:50.120
My wife she typed in the prompt or she talked in the prompt hit send

0:02:50.120,0:02:55.800
And it was almost immediate that it responded which is a little faster than just a normal question on the web version

0:02:57.000,0:03:01.200
so maybe there's that browse through the settings I

0:03:02.760,0:03:06.800
Kind of looked around the app. It's very bare-bones. It's mostly just

0:03:06.800,0:03:12.720
Chat GPT where you get to talk to chat GPT. So it really doesn't seem any different from the web version

0:03:12.720,0:03:18.640
So if you're on Android, you're not missing out on anything if you just open up the web version of chat GPT

0:03:19.200,0:03:22.240
That's essentially what it is except in the web version

0:03:23.480,0:03:25.760
If you use the web version on your desktop

0:03:26.000,0:03:30.960
You are familiar with the UI scheme and where things are so I guess there's a perk there, but

0:03:30.960,0:03:37.120
Yeah, I was I was a little interested and what was gonna go on with the chat GPT iOS and

0:03:37.920,0:03:42.320
a little disappointed it would have been at least it would have been cool if you could have a

0:03:43.000,0:03:46.400
Conversation back and forth you talk to it. It talks back to you

0:03:46.400,0:03:51.680
You didn't have to press send every time you use their voice to text a little extra features like that

0:03:52.240,0:03:55.120
Would have went a long way. So in my opinion the

0:03:55.920,0:03:57.920
being

0:03:57.920,0:03:59.920
chat GPT

0:03:59.920,0:04:01.920
chat GPT is

0:04:03.040,0:04:06.080
Better on phones you can talk to it and it talks back

0:04:06.560,0:04:12.840
With references and all this other sort of nonsense that you may or may not want and you can set its temperament. So

0:04:13.760,0:04:18.800
If you really want an app to use on your phone to talk to chat GPT or type to it

0:04:18.800,0:04:21.780
I would use the Bing chat one just in general

0:04:22.200,0:04:28.320
Now if you like chat GPT for like storytelling and long longer form conversations, so it doesn't cut you off

0:04:28.320,0:04:29.960
of course

0:04:29.960,0:04:34.760
You're not gonna get that with the Bing one the Bing one cuts you off pretty quick as soon as it starts to

0:04:35.320,0:04:38.400
Notice it's building up a temper. So that's

0:04:39.040,0:04:41.960
That's what the chat GPT official

0:04:42.920,0:04:48.040
iOS app is a little underwhelming. Oh, well, it's what we got in

0:04:49.920,0:04:51.920
Smaller amount of news that

0:04:51.920,0:04:58.600
Not many people may have heard of yet is that Google Chrome is going to be detecting

0:04:58.680,0:05:05.800
typos inside of the URL box and it says that it will make suggestions of

0:05:06.760,0:05:08.960
What it thought you meant now

0:05:08.960,0:05:16.040
I think this can be abused where you could go to type in something and it's going to overly

0:05:16.040,0:05:22.200
Be aggressive and suggest you things that are Google services or Google affiliated

0:05:22.760,0:05:28.040
Services or websites that highly integrate with Google and make a lot of Google ad revenue

0:05:28.360,0:05:31.960
So I think there is room for it to be abused. However in

0:05:32.800,0:05:34.800
principle the very base

0:05:35.320,0:05:37.320
concept of

0:05:37.520,0:05:39.280
detecting a

0:05:39.280,0:05:40.920
URL

0:05:40.920,0:05:42.760
mistype and

0:05:42.760,0:05:50.120
Suggesting you a correction. I think is a good idea. Why do I think it's a good idea? It's because I don't spell things

0:05:50.720,0:05:54.600
Good. I sometimes I I type like a normal person

0:05:55.280,0:05:58.340
Or I type in the standard way I should say

0:05:58.920,0:06:03.420
You know index fingers on the F into J and thumbs on the spacebar all that nonsense

0:06:04.280,0:06:05.640
so

0:06:05.640,0:06:07.640
Even though I do that I wind up

0:06:07.640,0:06:14.440
Tripping up or missing a key or my fingers going in a way where I just I try to hit a number

0:06:14.560,0:06:20.200
For example when I hit the wrong number and things get a little offset. It's very rare, but it happens enough

0:06:20.840,0:06:27.680
For me to worry about it. So often what I do is rather than typing in direct URL of

0:06:28.320,0:06:29.760
say

0:06:29.760,0:06:32.960
some specific website I will

0:06:32.960,0:06:39.600
Even if I've typed it a thousand times even if it auto fills it and says this is the one that you're likely gonna do

0:06:39.600,0:06:41.600
because you did it previously I

0:06:42.720,0:06:49.480
Still will type it in as a search query. And when I do a search query I have I have

0:06:50.280,0:06:57.360
The ability to select the link that I want I can just click on it and that makes me feel a little more

0:06:57.360,0:07:02.840
Secure and what I'm typing so it's become a habit of mine to just search for

0:07:04.480,0:07:08.640
For whatever site I'm going to now if it's a simple site that I've used a million times

0:07:08.920,0:07:11.320
say like a YouTube or Twitter or or

0:07:12.120,0:07:13.560
Whatever have you?

0:07:13.560,0:07:18.240
Or my own sites that I've set up. I'm not likely going to do that

0:07:18.840,0:07:22.680
Kind of roundabout effort, but if it's a site I use occasionally

0:07:23.200,0:07:24.960
like

0:07:24.960,0:07:26.800
bills or

0:07:26.800,0:07:33.760
things of that nature where I may check it every month or or I may go to it a few times a week or

0:07:33.760,0:07:37.000
Something like that not bills, but you know just general stuff

0:07:38.000,0:07:43.760
then I will type it in to a search box and click on the link rather than typing it out because

0:07:44.920,0:07:50.280
The last thing I want to do is for that tiny little takes at the top of the URL and a distant screen for me

0:07:50.280,0:07:57.040
For me to put an L instead of an I or something and hit enter and it takes me to some phishing site

0:07:57.040,0:08:00.360
which is cloned whatever website they know I'm trying to go to and

0:08:01.400,0:08:05.040
So, you know call me a little bit

0:08:05.680,0:08:08.440
of a worry wart in that way, but

0:08:09.360,0:08:14.960
It makes sure that I don't mess up and do something that I'm gonna regret because those people

0:08:14.960,0:08:19.840
They'll they'll steal your whole life away if you if you let them so I

0:08:20.680,0:08:22.800
think the general concept of

0:08:23.520,0:08:30.520
When you type something in a URL bar, it gives you suggestions. I think it's a fantastic idea. I wish other browsers

0:08:32.280,0:08:34.520
Brave or duck duck go or whatever

0:08:35.760,0:08:40.320
Firefox I wish they would all do it but that they would suggest

0:08:40.320,0:08:46.160
Meaningful sites I can see that Google does have an incentive. They don't just make

0:08:46.920,0:08:49.480
Features, especially ones as low-key as this

0:08:50.760,0:08:57.360
For free. So of course, they're gonna use it for some sort of advertising or we're pushing certain types of products over others

0:08:58.000,0:09:02.480
Which is gonna be annoying but the base idea is there and I think that everything should adopt it

0:09:02.480,0:09:08.480
I think it's a great way to solve a problem and put my mind at ease. I don't know if I'll

0:09:08.480,0:09:12.080
Trust it to start but maybe it'll get me over my habit of having to

0:09:12.800,0:09:14.800
search for sites and

0:09:15.120,0:09:18.280
Go based off a search engine. So we'll find out on that

0:09:18.800,0:09:23.960
Augmented reality it's it's a specific type of virtual

0:09:24.840,0:09:26.280
reality

0:09:26.280,0:09:28.600
That I enjoy more than virtual reality

0:09:29.280,0:09:30.680
so

0:09:30.680,0:09:36.880
You'll find people who are in the augmented reality camp and really want to be in that space and then you'll find the people

0:09:36.880,0:09:41.640
In the virtual reality camp and really want to be in that space now, of course

0:09:42.160,0:09:44.160
People can be interested in both

0:09:44.480,0:09:50.880
However, you usually have people who are weighted more towards one than the other for me. It's augmented reality

0:09:50.880,0:09:57.240
I really love the idea of augmented reality having the space around you and being in the real world and

0:09:57.960,0:09:59.560
augmenting it

0:09:59.560,0:10:03.520
That's awesome. That's something straight out of you know, I robot or or

0:10:03.520,0:10:10.320
You know, I robot or or minority report or whatever, you know, all those those cool sci-fi movies

0:10:10.560,0:10:11.960
so being able to

0:10:11.960,0:10:17.560
put a video and pen it to a wall and just like walk around and have it stuck to that wall where you left it and

0:10:18.040,0:10:22.840
And place things and pin them to the world is I don't know. It's just kind of a really neat

0:10:23.480,0:10:25.480
Concept to me virtual reality

0:10:26.160,0:10:27.960
kind of

0:10:27.960,0:10:32.800
Absorbs your senses and that you put you into a 3d world. So it it's

0:10:32.800,0:10:37.960
Fun and and all that but it really isn't something you could do for all day

0:10:37.960,0:10:40.920
I can see augmented reality in some ways

0:10:41.560,0:10:47.400
Be an all-day thing for work or whatever something that just because you're still part of the real world

0:10:47.400,0:10:49.400
you're just putting things around in it and

0:10:51.400,0:10:57.560
That I think is where the appeal is for me now the one problem I have with augmented reality is a lot of the

0:10:57.560,0:11:03.320
Game developers. It's not a problem with augmented reality per se is problem with the ideas people are having

0:11:03.320,0:11:08.680
a lot of the time people are having these ideas of board games you can put a

0:11:09.640,0:11:15.960
Board game on a table and you have these 3d characters and special effects and meteorites and dragons come down and moving

0:11:15.960,0:11:19.160
And that's kind of cool for a movie aspect

0:11:19.640,0:11:26.160
But what about games that involve moving around and puzzle solving and you know different parts?

0:11:26.160,0:11:32.760
It's not just stuck on a table and a lot of other augmented reality is kind of I don't know what to call it

0:11:32.760,0:11:33.960
It's the

0:11:33.960,0:11:38.640
Nintendo DS effect where they give you those cards and then you can look at them and a little character pops out

0:11:38.640,0:11:41.080
It's the same kind of concept as the board game

0:11:41.720,0:11:43.720
now that being said

0:11:43.840,0:11:50.960
There's this cool project. Somebody's messing around with and I really like it. It's basically portals. It's there's not a whole lot to it

0:11:50.960,0:11:52.960
you've got two portals and

0:11:52.960,0:11:56.200
You can smack the objects around between these portals

0:11:56.280,0:12:00.480
So you pass it in that portal will come out the other one on the other side and you can pass it through

0:12:00.720,0:12:04.680
and that's a really neat concept because now you're getting out of the space of

0:12:06.360,0:12:09.100
Tabletop things and you're getting into the space of

0:12:10.080,0:12:15.480
Objects moving within your space and you're interacting with them with your hand in this scenario

0:12:15.880,0:12:20.800
so, of course you have the challenge of not being able to feel the object so

0:12:20.800,0:12:24.440
It's it's a little difficult to perceive

0:12:25.120,0:12:26.400
but

0:12:26.400,0:12:30.520
This guy seems to be handling it just fine. He's I

0:12:31.240,0:12:36.800
Think it does a palm check from the looks of it kind of like a like a flat plane is

0:12:37.120,0:12:43.200
Where the hand is and that's what he's kind of using to bash this stuff around. It's really cool. So

0:12:44.000,0:12:48.720
This is the kind of stuff. I'm hoping to see more in the future. I want to see more games like this imagine

0:12:48.720,0:12:50.160
some

0:12:50.160,0:12:54.160
Escape-room kind of scenario where you can multiplayer with a friend

0:12:54.840,0:12:59.920
Things could be hidden in the room where you can find levers and pull them and things other things change in the room

0:13:00.680,0:13:07.840
It's just I think there's a lot of cool things we can do with this kind of concept and get out of the gimmick

0:13:08.400,0:13:10.400
realm of augmented reality

0:13:11.840,0:13:14.320
So if you guys have any suggestions or concepts

0:13:14.320,0:13:19.280
Augmented reality. Let me know if you like virtual reality more than

0:13:20.480,0:13:26.760
Augmented reality. I'd love to hear your arguments for it. I I think that you know, there's a lot of

0:13:27.440,0:13:32.040
Things in that space you can think of all the games that are out there. You can think of

0:13:33.480,0:13:36.000
Zuckerberg land, whatever it's called. I can't remember

0:13:37.440,0:13:39.440
metaverse so

0:13:39.440,0:13:45.080
There's a lot of stuff out there for VR. So it does have substance. I'd like to see a lot more kind of go into

0:13:45.360,0:13:47.760
augmented reality and I have another

0:13:48.960,0:13:52.520
time I have another thing in this topic of augmented reality and

0:13:53.520,0:13:56.960
It's this article here. Let's see. Let me open it up

0:13:58.640,0:14:00.360
It's

0:14:00.360,0:14:02.760
Mainly just text. I want to see if I can

0:14:03.440,0:14:05.440
get a picture of

0:14:05.440,0:14:13.200
The person using it. So this this is on the verge this lady is

0:14:14.160,0:14:18.200
Using this augmented reality set from what it looks like. It's a keyboard

0:14:18.720,0:14:22.480
Looks like it has a trackpad and it's connected to these glasses

0:14:23.080,0:14:27.720
Now this isn't anything new. There's actually quite a few products out there for

0:14:28.360,0:14:34.480
Glasses that connect to some kind of device whether it's your phone or a laptop and project screens and all that

0:14:34.480,0:14:37.800
But in this one, it's neat because it looks like it doesn't have a screen at all

0:14:38.480,0:14:45.680
It's just some glasses. I guess this is the protective case that you could put the glasses underneath you can close this perhaps

0:14:46.440,0:14:48.440
keyboard and trackpad and

0:14:49.120,0:14:53.160
Oh this this camera must be for maybe gestures or something like that

0:14:55.240,0:14:58.800
But I I haven't fully

0:14:58.800,0:15:03.760
Fully figured out everything that's going on in this thing. There's a second person using it and I guess this is

0:15:04.280,0:15:07.480
either a projected example or it's

0:15:08.080,0:15:13.880
Potentially a mock-up of what this dude sees it's the same device. I

0:15:14.480,0:15:16.480
Think this might be a mock-up of what they're seeing

0:15:17.080,0:15:18.360
but

0:15:18.360,0:15:20.360
Like this is this is really cool

0:15:20.360,0:15:26.040
This is you don't have a screen that you're kind of staring at you can put it at a nice viewing distance

0:15:26.040,0:15:32.080
If you're like me and you have eyes with two different that require two vastly different lenses

0:15:32.920,0:15:34.920
for glasses

0:15:34.960,0:15:40.160
This is fantastic because you can get the effect of having things more clear

0:15:41.640,0:15:46.840
Through this digital medium and what I mean by that is for example, it's hard to explain

0:15:46.840,0:15:52.040
I have so in my right eye. It's it's much more blurry than my left eye

0:15:52.040,0:15:57.160
My left eye is actually pretty good. My right eye is incredibly blurry is accident when I was a child

0:15:57.480,0:15:58.960
there's a

0:15:58.960,0:16:04.800
When I look at the viewfinder in a camera with my blurry eye, it's clear as day

0:16:04.800,0:16:07.800
It's I can see everything around it's like wearing

0:16:08.440,0:16:10.440
superglasses, so

0:16:10.960,0:16:13.960
Augmented reality I feel like has a fantastic

0:16:14.640,0:16:17.080
Benefit of being able to make those screens

0:16:17.080,0:16:25.720
clearer because you'll be able to adjust the kind of the lenses and their focus and all that sort of stuff

0:16:25.720,0:16:31.320
So it's just I don't know it's gonna be wonderful. I can't wait for it. I really like to try this

0:16:31.840,0:16:34.240
This device out. I'm sure it's gonna be super expensive

0:16:34.240,0:16:40.560
So I'm probably not gonna try anytime soon, but the moment this sort of device becomes more commercial and consumer grade

0:16:41.400,0:16:44.840
It's probably gonna be something that I mess with even if it's just a little bit of a

0:16:44.840,0:16:49.800
It's probably gonna be something that I mess with even if I look like a dork with the glasses on I mean, whatever

0:16:49.800,0:16:54.000
It doesn't matter, especially if I'm in the privacy of my own home. I mean

0:16:55.120,0:17:01.200
What does matter so super excited about augmented reality super excited about seeing these things coming to augmented reality?

0:17:01.200,0:17:09.000
The concepts and and all of these new gadgets. I don't know. I'm just really hyped about this

0:17:09.000,0:17:16.000
Unfinished projects. This is something that plagues developers of all kinds.

0:17:16.000,0:17:24.000
As a game developer, I know it plagues me constantly to never finish projects.

0:17:24.000,0:17:37.000
And I've seen a lot of articles. There's articles in basically every single development news, blog, site in existence.

0:17:37.000,0:17:44.000
Who is either talking about the graveyard of all of the projects that they've never finished.

0:17:44.000,0:17:50.000
Or they talk about ideas on how to actually finish projects.

0:17:50.000,0:18:00.000
Now, I do feel somewhat incomplete when I have this big idea for a project.

0:18:00.000,0:18:03.000
Big, grandiose idea. Got all the bells and whistles.

0:18:03.000,0:18:12.000
One of the problems I have is that I maybe replay the entire concept in my head so many times that it gets boring and I move on to something else.

0:18:12.000,0:18:16.000
But, you know, that's the way it works.

0:18:16.000,0:18:20.000
Now, some advice on dead projects.

0:18:20.000,0:18:23.000
There will always be another project.

0:18:23.000,0:18:29.000
And we have all come up with ideas that we gave up on that somebody else wound up finishing and making tons of money on.

0:18:29.000,0:18:31.000
It's happened to all of us.

0:18:31.000,0:18:39.000
At least three or four of my projects, somebody went out and made millions of dollars doing the same thing, except they've completed it.

0:18:39.000,0:18:42.000
So it has extra things that I didn't think of.

0:18:42.000,0:18:51.000
So, generally, I think it's good to first calm down and relax.

0:18:51.000,0:18:54.000
Life is long. Life is short.

0:18:54.000,0:18:58.000
There are many more important things than finishing projects.

0:18:58.000,0:19:02.000
Your kids are having kids at all.

0:19:02.000,0:19:15.000
That's a fantastic thing that I know you think is probably a clich� if you don't have kids to think that everybody, ugh, everyone says that and then they have kids and all of a sudden they're all about kids.

0:19:15.000,0:19:22.000
Now, it does give a completely new meaning to life and a whole new purpose just by its very nature.

0:19:22.000,0:19:25.000
But I'm not here to talk about that.

0:19:25.000,0:19:28.000
I'm just here to say that's one of many things.

0:19:28.000,0:19:45.000
It could be the studies you have with friends or the groups that you go and meet up on or the random projects you do with groups or your work or your church or there's so many things in the list of more important things than finishing your project.

0:19:45.000,0:19:52.000
Don't let finishing your projects or dead projects or graveyards of projects make you feel bad.

0:19:52.000,0:19:56.000
I don't feel bad for all the projects that I have not completed and it is a lot.

0:19:56.000,0:19:58.000
My GitHub is enormous.

0:19:58.000,0:20:03.000
I have to scroll a long way to look through and find an old project.

0:20:03.000,0:20:19.000
And that's, you know, one of the best things that come out of not completing projects and just doing the parts you like and then going on to something else or any of that is that it's iteration.

0:20:19.000,0:20:20.000
You learn from it.

0:20:20.000,0:20:32.000
Each time you do that, you make some progress on either a new idea or you become a better developer just in general, whether you learn some art, learn some programming or what have you.

0:20:32.000,0:20:52.000
Now, I know that I've learned tons of stuff as far as networking and art and tools for art and game engines and code and code paradigms, good structure and everything else, because sometimes my projects are just about doing a project that fits a code standard that I've never done before.

0:20:52.000,0:21:01.000
And those dead projects all add up, you know, in your mind and it gives you that history that you can then use later.

0:21:01.000,0:21:11.000
So all the articles that I see a lot of people either complaining about how it makes them feel absolutely terrible, they get burned out and they take breaks.

0:21:11.000,0:21:12.000
I've talked about this before.

0:21:12.000,0:21:22.000
I've never been burnt out in the past 15 years and I don't see myself getting burned out on programming in the next 15 either or until I die.

0:21:22.000,0:21:26.000
I'll probably die with my hands on the keyboard typing out some line of code or something.

0:21:26.000,0:21:30.000
So don't let it get to you.

0:21:30.000,0:21:34.000
And that's just something that I think has been creeping up a lot.

0:21:34.000,0:21:43.000
It's crept up a lot over the past couple of years, since 2020, because a lot of people have been trying to make some kind of projects.

0:21:43.000,0:21:47.000
Now, there's a lot of programmers out there and there's a lot of people making projects.

0:21:47.000,0:21:49.000
You can't expect to be the guy.

0:21:49.000,0:22:01.000
That's what I tell my friends and some of my family who feel depressed whenever they didn't complete something or they can't stick to a regiment is you don't need to be the guy.

0:22:01.000,0:22:07.000
The guy is out there in the world and he'll do great things, but the grass is always greener.

0:22:07.000,0:22:10.000
That person wishes they're you and you wish you were them.

0:22:10.000,0:22:12.000
It's just how it goes.

0:22:12.000,0:22:25.000
Just enjoy the process of coming up with ideas, writing them down, drawing them, sketching them, making flow charts, coding up stuff, trying out new engines and new languages.

0:22:25.000,0:22:27.000
Just enjoy it.

0:22:27.000,0:22:30.000
Would you rather be sitting around watching TV all day?

0:22:30.000,0:22:37.000
I'm sure that a lot of people who listen to podcasts like this are thinking about something or they want to work on something or they have it in the background.

0:22:37.000,0:22:45.000
It's just another form of entertainment, I think is what I'm getting at.

0:22:45.000,0:22:50.000
When you do these projects, it's entertaining and that's what it should be.

0:22:50.000,0:22:53.000
That's the whole point of doing them is to have fun.

0:22:53.000,0:22:57.000
So don't have high expectations for your project.

0:22:57.000,0:23:00.000
Just do the things that you love about it.

0:23:00.000,0:23:02.000
If you're tired of it, move on.

0:23:02.000,0:23:04.000
It's that simple.

0:23:04.000,0:23:09.000
Honestly, we're pretty good at that because we have graveyards of projects, now don't we?

0:23:09.000,0:23:12.000
So three quick articles that I came across today.

0:23:12.000,0:23:17.000
One is Twitter Blue subscribers now can upload two-hour videos.

0:23:17.000,0:23:19.000
I think it was an hour before.

0:23:19.000,0:23:23.000
If you're into Twitter Blue, then you get longer videos.

0:23:23.000,0:23:27.000
It's good to see that they're adding features to Twitter Blue.

0:23:27.000,0:23:29.000
I know it was a big old stink.

0:23:29.000,0:23:31.000
I have no opinion.

0:23:31.000,0:23:36.000
I don't like to make everything a political argument.

0:23:36.000,0:23:41.000
I think some things just let sleeping dogs lie.

0:23:41.000,0:23:53.000
So I think Twitter Blue is a good example of that in principle because it attempts to move away from advertising and collecting your data,

0:23:53.000,0:23:55.000
even though they continue to do that.

0:23:55.000,0:24:05.000
I think if Twitter was able to get the subscriber backing that they needed, they would probably phase out ads just as a feature.

0:24:05.000,0:24:08.000
If you do Twitter Blue, it'll completely remove ads.

0:24:08.000,0:24:14.000
So I think that adding these new features to Twitter Blue is great.

0:24:14.000,0:24:16.000
It's great to see that they're adding them.

0:24:16.000,0:24:17.000
I mean, this isn't a huge one.

0:24:17.000,0:24:22.000
It's just extending the frame, the time length of videos, but not bad.

0:24:22.000,0:24:26.000
Hopefully we'll see some more, and I'm interested to see how that goes.

0:24:26.000,0:24:30.000
So the next one is the Steam Deck.

0:24:30.000,0:24:37.000
The Steam Deck has a full HD plus display upgrade.

0:24:37.000,0:24:41.000
And here's the article on that from XDA Developers.

0:24:41.000,0:24:56.000
It's $100, and it upgrades to 1920 by 1200 for the resolution from what it currently is, which is 1280 by 800.

0:24:56.000,0:25:03.000
I'm assuming the HD plus, the plus is the added pixels on the vertical because it's not 1920 by 1080.

0:25:03.000,0:25:09.000
Now I checked through this ad, and I didn't see anything about how it affects your battery life.

0:25:09.000,0:25:18.000
I assume if you're going to be driving a higher density display, you're probably going to wind up using more battery.

0:25:18.000,0:25:29.000
For me personally, I wouldn't pay $100 for this upgrade because I hold the Steam Deck at a comfortable distance from my face,

0:25:29.000,0:25:32.000
and I can play it. It feels good. Everything looks fine.

0:25:32.000,0:25:37.000
The size of the screen, it plays well with the resolution.

0:25:37.000,0:25:45.000
If you're one of those people who are more affected by seeing the pixels and the density, maybe this upgrade is for you.

0:25:45.000,0:25:48.000
I don't know. It's definitely cool.

0:25:48.000,0:25:52.000
If somebody does this upgrade, please let me know how you feel about it.

0:25:52.000,0:25:55.000
Does it drain your battery?

0:25:55.000,0:25:58.000
I do want to see more Steam Deck mods because I love the Steam Deck.

0:25:58.000,0:26:03.000
I have a Steam Deck. I bought my wife the Steam Deck. It's a great device.

0:26:03.000,0:26:07.000
I know there's new alternatives now with Asus, I think.

0:26:07.000,0:26:15.000
But the Steam Deck is nice because it's sold a lot, and it's a constant, kind of a fixed type of device right now.

0:26:15.000,0:26:24.000
So the dimensions and all of that, they're uniform, and so a lot of cool gadgets and add-ons and those sorts of things can be added for it.

0:26:24.000,0:26:28.000
So yeah, check this out if it's something that interests you.

0:26:28.000,0:26:32.000
Steam Deck Full HD Plus Display.

0:26:32.000,0:26:36.000
$100 doesn't seem that bad for a display upgrade.

0:26:36.000,0:26:38.000
I don't know. I don't upgrade displays.

0:26:38.000,0:26:45.000
It's cheaper than a monitor, a 1080p monitor, so maybe that's worth it.

0:26:45.000,0:26:59.000
And then the third quick story that I have is Stability AI releases Stable Studio, an open-source future of Dream Studio.

0:26:59.000,0:27:06.000
So this is an image generation AI. I haven't used it but maybe once or twice just to play around with it.

0:27:06.000,0:27:10.000
You go to the site, you have some tokens. It's kind of like the Bing.

0:27:10.000,0:27:20.000
I think Bing uses DALI from OpenAI where you get some tokens and you can generate some pictures based on using those tokens,

0:27:20.000,0:27:24.000
and then you buy more tokens. For Bing, you search more and get tokens that you can use.

0:27:24.000,0:27:29.000
These are coins. I don't know what Bing calls them.

0:27:29.000,0:27:37.000
Stability AI has released a GitHub repository. Let me see if I can load it up here.

0:27:37.000,0:27:41.000
Here's their landing page about it.

0:27:41.000,0:27:46.000
They have Stable Studio. If I click on this, it'll take me to GitHub.

0:27:46.000,0:27:53.000
Now, this was exciting at first because I thought, oh, we're getting closer to more local AI, which is what I want.

0:27:53.000,0:28:01.000
I want private local AI. I don't want cloud-based AI. I think that's just asking for disaster.

0:28:01.000,0:28:10.000
I want local private AI. I want to be able to send my local private AI to go on the Internet to do things for me anonymously

0:28:10.000,0:28:21.000
so I don't have to go on there and drudge through the madness that is coming from all the AI stuff that's about to spawn on the Internet

0:28:21.000,0:28:24.000
or already has spawned on the Internet.

0:28:24.000,0:28:30.000
Now, this is not a step closer to private local AI. It's nice that they made it.

0:28:30.000,0:28:40.000
It seems like it's just taking their web studio app, web app, and allowing you to run it locally.

0:28:40.000,0:28:49.000
Now, it does not run the image generation locally. You are required to use your API key for Stability AI.

0:28:49.000,0:29:01.000
So it's basically saying instead of using their website and costing them money to host the website, you host it and still pay for the API key.

0:29:01.000,0:29:06.000
And that makes sense. Everybody's got to make their money, right? It's a capitalist society. No problem with that.

0:29:06.000,0:29:14.000
I want these guys to continue. I want them to thrive. I want them to explore and go to the new frontier of artificial intelligence.

0:29:14.000,0:29:19.000
But I'm more interested in private local personal AI.

0:29:19.000,0:29:32.000
I know that, man, it's probably a pipe dream because you imagine that your phone is your private local device, but it's not.

0:29:32.000,0:29:38.000
You have Apple watching everything you do, knowing everything you're doing, how fast you're going, obviously.

0:29:38.000,0:29:47.000
They do the emergency alerts and hiding behind the auspices of protecting lives is a great way to spy on people, honestly.

0:29:47.000,0:29:53.000
They think they've got it. They've got the formula right there for that.

0:29:53.000,0:30:00.000
But I really want to see more private, just locally, AI that's mine.

0:30:00.000,0:30:05.000
And I doubt we're going to see it. We're going to see companies that come up with private local AI devices.

0:30:05.000,0:30:16.000
And maybe there will be some that are genuine, but the biggest hitters, like I bet you this will be something Google and Microsoft and Apple and everybody else does,

0:30:16.000,0:30:27.000
they'll probably tie it to the phone. And it's not private and local if it uses their web services or tracks what you do or any of that sort of nonsense.

0:30:27.000,0:30:36.000
I do. I'm a hopeful person. I'm mostly an optimist for all of life, everything. I try to see the silver lining, everything.

0:30:36.000,0:30:48.000
And I see wonderful things with private, locally AI that I can tell to do things or come up with ideas or go on the Internet and do things for me, all that sort of stuff.

0:30:48.000,0:30:53.000
I think that's a wonderful thing. And capturing memories, like, you know, we use phones to take pictures and videos.

0:30:53.000,0:31:05.000
But if I can store them in AI and AI can replay them and then when I'm dead, potentially be something that I can, my kids can review or they could just throw it away.

0:31:05.000,0:31:13.000
It doesn't matter to me. However, they want to grieve. That's fine with me. But I just think it would be really cool to do more local private AI.

0:31:13.000,0:31:20.000
And unfortunately, this sounded like it was, but really it's just, I think it's just the web. I actually tested it.

0:31:20.000,0:31:25.000
You use Yarn, fire up the web API, and then it just does API requests to their service.

0:31:25.000,0:31:37.000
So I think you might be able to hook it up to something like, it definitely isn't going to be a one-click solution right now.

0:31:37.000,0:31:41.000
I'll have to look more into it and let you know what I find.

0:31:41.000,0:31:52.000
But maybe that's the future, is it takes this web API front end that, or this web front end that allows you to query an AI and then you can change the back end.

0:31:52.000,0:31:58.000
That would be pretty dope. But I don't know if that's what it is. We shall find out.

0:31:58.000,0:32:03.600
So that's three kind of quick stories. And yeah, let me know what you think.

0:32:03.600,0:32:07.160
Google is back at its shenanigans

0:32:07.800,0:32:09.800
so

0:32:10.040,0:32:12.140
There's there's been an

0:32:12.680,0:32:18.920
There's been an announcement that Google is gonna be turning off third-party cookies for 1% of Chrome users

0:32:19.720,0:32:20.920
by

0:32:20.920,0:32:23.440
q1 of 2024 so

0:32:25.880,0:32:32.240
Anybody may be thinking about this and say well, that's awesome. You know cookies are annoying they track us they they

0:32:32.240,0:32:34.240
they're a way of

0:32:35.600,0:32:40.440
Saving little bits of data and seeing us cross sites and all this other sort of

0:32:41.000,0:32:46.160
Craziness, especially when you start embedding say Google logins or Facebook logins or whatever

0:32:47.240,0:32:53.360
integrations with third-party stuff then they can start tracking the people who come to your

0:32:54.120,0:32:57.840
Website or your web application or your mobile app or any of those?

0:32:58.480,0:33:00.440
so

0:33:00.440,0:33:03.640
Yeah, at first it sounds this is fantastic now

0:33:04.960,0:33:10.760
Those of us who think about security and use browsers that are more secure

0:33:11.520,0:33:12.840
All right

0:33:12.840,0:33:15.760
You know, you know like Firefox or brave

0:33:17.240,0:33:23.840
We use those browsers because they automatically block cookies or you may have privacy badger or you may have you know

0:33:23.960,0:33:25.960
Any of the various other?

0:33:25.960,0:33:30.600
plugins to block cookies and and stop trackers and

0:33:31.160,0:33:34.720
You may use duck calm or duck duck go as it's called

0:33:36.080,0:33:40.840
The funny news for a funny funny story about that Google actually

0:33:41.880,0:33:45.160
Registered duck calm a while back a long time ago

0:33:46.000,0:33:53.280
To prevent duck duck go from registering it. I think there was a whole lawsuit about it, but duck duck go now finally owns

0:33:53.280,0:33:56.440
Duck calm which is awesome

0:33:56.640,0:34:01.960
It's good that they're not into that weird battle and it's a lot easier to type a duck calm than it is to type duck

0:34:01.960,0:34:03.000
duck go

0:34:03.000,0:34:05.000
calm or whatever so

0:34:05.720,0:34:13.160
Anyways that aside you may be thinking this is a great idea Google. That sounds great now

0:34:14.160,0:34:18.640
What a lot of people point out is that Google as we've stated earlier is

0:34:18.640,0:34:22.320
Is is in the practice of favoring

0:34:25.760,0:34:31.960
Themselves and their third-party partners and people who use their services and ultimately make the money

0:34:32.800,0:34:35.800
Obviously, they're a corporation. They want to make money. They're gonna do that

0:34:37.120,0:34:41.400
So in general the background of this is Google has been talking about

0:34:41.400,0:34:47.840
Getting rid of these is the third-party cookies notice. It's called third-party cookies since

0:34:48.360,0:34:52.160
2020 and in three years, that's not happened at all

0:34:52.840,0:34:56.120
Now what Google is announcing is that in Chrome?

0:34:56.880,0:35:02.800
Build 115 which is gonna be released in July. It's a couple months from now

0:35:04.080,0:35:10.560
It will include the privacy sandbox feature flag and you can go into the the privacy sandbox

0:35:10.560,0:35:17.360
The privacy sandbox so you can go into the settings the flags of Chrome and you can turn it on at that point

0:35:17.720,0:35:19.920
to block those cookies

0:35:21.040,0:35:25.240
the goal is that this is a temporary thing for people and and

0:35:26.160,0:35:28.840
They're just gonna have it integrated normally

0:35:30.040,0:35:34.840
So it's gonna be a good benefit to stop tracking but it's gonna be a bad thing because

0:35:34.840,0:35:40.760
They don't mention anything about their cookies. And of course, it's their browser. They can see every site you go to

0:35:40.880,0:35:44.600
So it seems a little unfair to block everybody else, but you're special

0:35:45.280,0:35:47.280
like I think

0:35:47.920,0:35:53.280
That just one ups the browser wars, which is which is probably one of the reasons

0:35:54.120,0:36:01.720
Microsoft has hit so hard with being and being chat recently and you know, it's been pretty effective from what I can tell so

0:36:01.720,0:36:06.120
Now in order for Microsoft to do the tracking that they want or need

0:36:06.640,0:36:08.640
They have to have people in their browser

0:36:09.240,0:36:15.120
So just do yourself a favor get out of the browser wars of the big companies get off of Chrome

0:36:15.440,0:36:17.440
You don't have to get off of chromium

0:36:18.160,0:36:20.680
Basically every browser but Firefox is chromium

0:36:21.720,0:36:24.680
You can you can have multiple browsers installed

0:36:24.680,0:36:30.040
I have brave is my default browser right now and I have Firefox which is my default browser on Linux

0:36:30.040,0:36:33.880
and so I interchange them just it's

0:36:34.640,0:36:39.800
It's more convenient and I don't know. I don't know why it's convenient

0:36:39.800,0:36:43.720
It's convenient on Linux because it usually comes with Firefox built-in. I guess maybe that's why

0:36:44.800,0:36:50.040
but use browsers like those which already do the blocking and they're not biased because

0:36:50.560,0:36:58.040
They block Google and they block Microsoft just the same and maybe they'll block Google harder than the rest and that's okay with me

0:36:58.040,0:37:01.080
Because Google is a tyrant with tracking so

0:37:01.960,0:37:05.400
Yeah, swap your browsers. This is a cool story

0:37:06.120,0:37:07.640
but

0:37:07.640,0:37:12.520
Really? It seems like it's just a way for for Google to take more control

0:37:13.080,0:37:19.120
From other people who aren't Google and it's maybe a way for them to bully people into using their services

0:37:19.320,0:37:21.880
Like AdSense and and all those other

0:37:22.640,0:37:25.040
their web tracking stuff add words

0:37:25.040,0:37:30.640
Webmaster tools. It's probably a way of bullying people to stick with them, which is unfortunate

0:37:30.640,0:37:34.120
So just go to another browser ignore Google and the rest

0:37:34.120,0:37:38.440
So that's my advice on that piece of news good to see

0:37:38.840,0:37:43.240
but plenty of other browsers have already beaten you to it and plenty of plugins have to so

0:37:44.360,0:37:50.080
It's good for the less technical people. I guess as you may know, I am a programmer

0:37:50.080,0:37:57.760
I am a programmer by day and by night and by weekend and always I'm always a programmer

0:37:58.320,0:38:01.520
but at night I moonlight as a podcaster, so

0:38:02.680,0:38:04.680
Now we're gonna talk a little bit about code

0:38:05.280,0:38:07.200
.NET 8 is

0:38:07.200,0:38:12.840
Being released if you haven't heard this is all all the.NET people rejoice. I

0:38:12.840,0:38:19.120
I find that this one is mostly just kind of like build stuff

0:38:19.520,0:38:23.160
Which is cool better build stuff easier build stuff

0:38:23.320,0:38:30.040
The that's that's always nice when you focus on that and you don't add ridiculous parts to your languages like C sharp

0:38:30.040,0:38:34.560
I love C sharp, but man, do they add some confusing things in there?

0:38:36.520,0:38:38.520
Nullables are a really cool concept

0:38:39.360,0:38:41.200
for example and

0:38:41.200,0:38:45.840
They're good. If you start your project with nulls or nullables or non nullables

0:38:46.400,0:38:48.400
but

0:38:48.560,0:38:51.080
But if you add it in the middle of a project it

0:38:51.720,0:38:58.800
Really just wrecks things and I've had people add them into the middle of projects before and it becomes madness

0:38:58.800,0:39:00.800
So some of the features are cool

0:39:01.560,0:39:05.200
just in isolation, I suppose so

0:39:06.400,0:39:08.520
This one seems to be mostly

0:39:08.520,0:39:13.880
This is from from somebody on dev.to which I think is a dev blogging site

0:39:15.960,0:39:19.280
So there's MS build output upgrade

0:39:20.480,0:39:22.480
there is

0:39:22.960,0:39:27.000
Tweaks to the output path. There's new git stuff

0:39:29.240,0:39:31.240
Package signing for Linux

0:39:32.600,0:39:34.600
Dependencies

0:39:34.920,0:39:36.920
Auditing I

0:39:36.920,0:39:41.160
Don't know what this is handle vulnerable packages like a pro

0:39:41.160,0:39:45.000
Oh, I guess this is just old packages or haven't been updated in a while

0:39:47.080,0:39:49.080
Embrace the power of you

0:39:49.080,0:39:50.560
Oh

0:39:50.560,0:39:55.560
Uta span formatable. So utf-8 has been in C sharp for a long time

0:39:57.000,0:40:00.700
So you should have been embracing the power of utf-8 all along by the way

0:40:00.700,0:40:03.920
I embrace the power of utf-8 in my C code

0:40:03.920,0:40:08.360
Which I have to write functions for utf-8 myself

0:40:08.440,0:40:14.080
So you should be using it in a language that fully supports it, but it looks like it's getting some added

0:40:14.600,0:40:16.080
niceties

0:40:16.080,0:40:19.920
Which is always nice to say the least

0:40:21.680,0:40:23.680
Let's see ahead of time

0:40:24.640,0:40:26.440
compiler so

0:40:26.440,0:40:29.040
Did you know done a pre before console?

0:40:29.040,0:40:36.680
Ahead of time now one of the problems like with iOS is it does not allow for support of just-in-time

0:40:37.000,0:40:42.720
Compilers it doesn't like they don't want you adding scripting stuff in there or anything like that

0:40:42.960,0:40:49.320
You got to have pre compiled ahead of time all the way and this is one of the reasons unity had to swap

0:40:49.440,0:40:52.760
And create IL to CPP to convert everything

0:40:52.760,0:41:01.760
From C sharp IL to C++ now there's a lot. There's a misconception that people have that that just magically makes your code faster

0:41:01.760,0:41:05.680
It does not I don't know if you've seen the generated C++ code it is

0:41:06.160,0:41:12.760
Madness now it may be faster in certain algorithms because the compiler that compiles the C++

0:41:12.760,0:41:15.200
I don't know exactly which one they use it's probably clang

0:41:16.240,0:41:20.940
can pick up on code patterns and optimize a lot of the code in that way, so

0:41:20.940,0:41:28.340
There are areas where it can get faster, but in general it might actually be slower than the standard C sharp stuff

0:41:29.340,0:41:33.920
So anyways, that's that's a whole tangent on just-in-time compiler. Sorry about that

0:41:34.140,0:41:38.420
we've got some JSON deserialized stuff more JSON stuff and

0:41:39.180,0:41:42.180
some logging updates, so this is kind of I think a a

0:41:43.620,0:41:47.060
Quality of life upgrade not not a whole bunch of new

0:41:47.060,0:41:51.400
New system libraries or any of that. I don't think it really needs a whole lot more

0:41:51.420,0:41:57.980
There's quite a bit in C sharp to take advantage of you can't really use everything in one project. There's so much stuff so

0:41:58.820,0:42:03.940
Those of you who like net are probably gonna like this. I will put the

0:42:04.460,0:42:08.620
Put the link to this article. I'm sure you can find any there's tons of dotnet eight

0:42:09.820,0:42:16.260
Things out there. I just thought this was nice because is a kind of a little breakdown with with animated images

0:42:16.260,0:42:17.660
so

0:42:17.660,0:42:24.900
Yeah, I'll put this on Twitter. I'll put this in the description for you to check it out, but dotnet eight is here

0:42:25.380,0:42:28.140
Okay, so that's gonna do it for today. Hopefully

0:42:29.100,0:42:30.940
Hopefully that was informative

0:42:30.940,0:42:36.740
Let me know if you have any ideas for things you want me to talk about or maybe some cool stories in

0:42:37.060,0:42:45.200
Tech or programming or game development or just any of those kind of fields that you think I'd like just cinema cinema my way

0:42:45.200,0:42:47.200
I love going over this kind of stuff, so

0:42:47.200,0:43:13.860
Thanks for watching and until next time bye for now
