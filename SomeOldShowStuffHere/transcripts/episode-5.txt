0:00
jobs for programmers some of us need them some of us have them I was curious about remote work and how
0:09
it affects the job market what companies are doing with remote work I work remotely a lot of you maybe
0:16
work remotely and just kind of want to take a look at jobs but before I get into remote work I
0:23
want to take a look at losing jobs lots of people are losing jobs
0:28
yet another story today not today a couple days ago stack Overflow lays off
0:33
10 percent of their employees and that's not a lot I was surprised to find out that 10 percent of the stack
0:40
Overflow employee base was 58 employees which is pretty astounding I like that they run a
0:47
tight ship over there I think that having I mean that means they've got 580
0:54
employees I think that may be a little bit too high to run a question and answer site
1:00
I don't know I don't run a question and answer site I just think that oftentimes
1:05
we hire too many developers we hire way too many people and that's usually what
1:11
is uh slowing us down at companies interworking with people
1:17
so perhaps they're figuring figuring this out and you know laying off people I've
1:23
always said that programming is not an assembly line job you can't just add
1:29
more programmers and then all of a sudden magically produce tons more code there's been
1:37
studies of this that show that that's never the case you can look at the mythical man month from the 70s and that
1:45
still holds true believe it or not they did hire tons of programmers at companies even back then when there
1:51
weren't that many so just taking a look at something like that and that information has basically
1:58
held true this entire time we can start to see that you can't just
2:04
hire more programmers and more developers and expect things to go faster it's just not how it works
2:09
in fact I think the CEO of Nintendo he
2:15
famously was shown mother three I don't know which one it was Mother the uh the
2:22
game that has like Ness as the main character I think it's Ness I don't know who it is kid with baseball cap and uh
2:29
and uh the baseball bat
2:34
so it's it's this RPG and they presented it to him and he said this is going to take forever to
2:41
fix and so he said we can get it done in six
2:47
months if we start over from scratch and that's what they did they started over in scratch and I think it took seven or
2:52
eight months to complete the game and get it published and that just shows you that
2:58
sometimes having a lot of Legacy code it's easier just to scrap it all and do it from scratch and I'm a big proponent
3:04
of that however it's very hard to pull off in this day and age
3:10
anyways uh we have so stack Overflow fired or laid off I don't know is that
Layoffs
3:17
any different than firing I think it's the more PC language but they fired 58 employees which is 10 of their Workforce
3:25
they were saying that the CEO stack Overflow perhaps uh or his name is Pratt
3:32
I can't I can't even pronounce it pronounce his name I'll call him PC that says initials
3:39
um said that layoffs uh were also a result of taking a hard look at our strategic
3:45
priorities this fiscal year and the organizational
3:51
structure and that's usually how it goes they look in CEO we have a lot of bloat we had a Heyday during you know that
3:58
pandemic hired people maybe for things we didn't need and now we're kind of overpopulated and slowing
4:05
ourselves down just kind of drudging along once the ship gets bigger it's going to be harder to push it so
4:13
that's essentially um you know as vague as it is why Let It Go
4:20
the they want to pursue agility and flexibility with the launch of AI ml
4:26
focused offerings in the months ahead so everybody's going AI obviously I think
4:32
everybody can can look around and see that every company I mean most of Google
4:38
I O is just AI that's the buzzword that's what everybody's expecting it's
4:43
where all the investors are going even though they probably wouldn't have touched it with a 10 foot a 10-foot pole like five years ago
4:50
and so a stack Overflow is in Jeopardy honestly when you have
4:56
a I mean I'm I think I've seen articles about a dip in their user base ever
5:01
since like um chat GPT was announced and GitHub co-pilot and these kinds of AI generated
5:08
code and I can see why it's very easy to just write a comment in your code it's a
5:14
save a file and it detects the language and it gives you basically what you
5:19
would have went to stack Overflow for a little copy and paste snippet so I don't know exactly what they're going to do
5:25
with artificial intelligence I think the only way they can save themselves is if they compete with things like copilot
5:32
and they produce an artificial intelligence that takes the entire base of knowledge of stack Overflow and all the
5:39
suggestions there and kind of works from that although
5:45
Microsoft's you know they bought GitHub for a reason and I was to have access to
5:50
all the code on GitHub whether we like it or not to train their AIS so they have a much bigger code base
5:57
to work from so that that's that's you know just nature
6:03
of the business but I don't want to focus too much just on stack overflow um
6:09
ironically and this one is is ironic to me because we all know about all the
6:14
layoffs that are happening there's layoffs at every big company you can think of games software nobody is safe
6:21
in the um software Realm and the I don't want to say the funniest
6:29
but it is kind of funny LinkedIn Cuts 700 jobs and closes their China app so I
6:36
can understand why they close their China app I mean that's a whole other discussion about you know
6:42
Chinese firewall and kind of their regulatory stuff that
6:48
makes it very difficult to do stuff there so besides the point but they cut 700 jobs at LinkedIn
6:55
um it's ironic because you would imagine with everybody getting laid off from every big company there's a lot of
7:01
people who are going to be paying for LinkedIn and trying to get jobs so it's
7:07
weird to me that a job search website and I I have an article here that says
7:14
let's see um here let's take a look
7:19
says more than 197 000 Tech sector employees have lost
7:24
their jobs since the start of 2023. this isn't even talking about 2022.
7:30
um so you know 200 000 people looking for jobs and Linkedin is uh they're cutting they're cutting 700 jobs from
7:38
from their company which does that mean people are not looking
7:44
for jobs does it mean they're not looking through Linkedin or they just is LinkedIn just not a viable thing for
7:51
finding jobs I don't know what to take of this um I've I've gotten jobs through
7:57
Linkedin recruiters so it's a little strange to me I think that it's pretty effective there's a lot of
8:03
Recruiters on there and there's a lot of noise daily I get I get recruiters hitting me
8:09
up for jobs I sometimes feel like I need to close down my thing whenever I I take
8:15
a job that I'm happy with but there's a lot of recruiters and there's it seems to be a lot of jobs
8:20
because I you know I get them for artificial intelligence games mobile
8:27
apps just the whole Spectrum so I don't know uh so it's very odd I don't
8:34
know what to take of it I don't know if it's a a good omen a bad Omen that they're cut jobs but something to think
8:40
about um but they're not the only ones so um it looks like May 3rd Unity conducts
8:49
a third round of layoffs this is the unity game engine um if you're not a game developer that's
8:55
the one I'm talking about uh they've they've cut uh something about eight
9:02
percent of their staff which is another 600 people getting laid off and I guess this is a third round I
9:09
have no idea what happened in the first couple of rounds uh how many people went got laid off in that and so
9:18
um very interesting again games are doing great right now but
9:24
I don't know if if it's just the trend all the big Tech Bros are talking to each other at their
9:30
yacht meetups or whatever rich people do and saying hey look we can just cut a
9:36
whole bunch of jobs look Elon Musk did it you like cut Twitter to nothing and uh still the thing is running and you
9:44
know tons of people are using it and it hasn't totally collapsed maybe we could do the same I don't know
9:51
um but usually once one person does it it really starts a chain reaction they
9:57
all realize hey maybe we're bloated we need to save some money inflation is happening all kinds of weird stuff's
10:03
happening um you know banks are collapsing maybe we should start cutting people to save
10:09
money I don't know uh but it's very interesting um you know it's affecting everybody
10:15
from games to software to tech companies is the whole Spectrum even LinkedIn if
10:20
linkedin's being hit and you know everything's being hit it's uh that's the way I see it so
10:28
I have uh I did I did see something
Overseas hires while we fires
10:34
um from times now news amid Mass layoffs uh there's a particular I.T company an
10:42
Indian I.T company that is hiring like 1500 people and that's not unheard of I actually was
10:50
fired I will call it fired laid off whatever you want to call it
10:55
um I was laid off it was it was part of uh I was part of a studio a game studio
11:01
and we were making money we the company was already bought once and they were about to be bought again and they
11:07
decided to lean up and what they did was they brought in a bunch of um I don't know if they were uh I never
11:15
asked them I think they were Russian they may have been Ukrainian the guy
11:22
that was kind of communicating with them and working with them he was Russian so I don't know what the people on the
11:28
other end was they didn't really explain it much but after working with them and
11:33
they got integrated with the team they laid off everybody in the United States
11:38
for that company and offshored everything so it makes perfect sense
11:44
that it'd be offshoring you know offshore companies would be hiring tons
11:51
and tons of new new people and that could be exactly what it is it's uh you
11:58
know I think that's going to be unnecessary with all the AI stuff that
12:03
we're creating because um it can do it much more efficiently and you can have one programmer who's a
12:10
little more effective Maybe he's got a he's got a no code you can't
12:15
just hire anybody to just put in prompts for AI you got to have somebody who knows code inside and out so I guess the
12:22
upper echelons of coders your jobs are safe so don't worry about
12:27
that so there's been a lot of layoffs Intel
Counting the tech layoffs
12:35
did more layoffs on May 9th it looks like so you've got
12:43
Intel and Google Amazon meta Microsoft and just tons of companies just even
12:48
this month laying off people and I think that we're tired of seeing all the headlines
12:53
because we've seen them basically every month for like a year but it's still going and
13:01
that's uh that's pretty crazy luckily I've not had any problems with
13:06
this um you know since way back when and that scenario I was talking about but it is
13:13
unfortunate for a lot of people I I don't know how to deal with job security there when you're in a huge
13:19
company like these uh some of these big companies Intel Microsoft they'll probably cut important people
13:26
not not even knowing they just need they just need big sections to just disappear
13:32
so that they can uh kind of Reserve their funds so that's that's
13:39
kind of the crazy stuff that's going on in the job stuff I'm not worried at all if you're secure in your job
13:46
you don't have to worry uh if you're a really good programmer and you know many languages and you can go
13:51
cross-discipline you really don't have to worry you're going to be fine so
13:57
and if you do get laid off like I said I get I get tons of stuff in LinkedIn I know there's stuff out there for you so
14:04
if you are laid off if you're not something to think about everything's
14:09
good that brings us to remote work so I
Remote work
14:15
started to think about remote work today because um Elon Musk did a long interview and
14:20
one of the things that came up with that was remote work you you probably know elon's point of view on remote work
14:28
and um you know I'm somewhat ambivalent to
14:33
remote work I think that it has its benefits for those of us uh like me who
14:40
have family and a place that's not so techy and it has its huge downsides which will
14:48
also kind of cover so uh kind of what he went over today
14:53
was he opposes the work from home policies and called out remote work and
14:59
said it was morally wrong he suggested that work from home policies and are fundamentally unfair since every
15:06
employee can work from home pointing to a factory uh appointing to factory and
15:13
food workers so um and basically what he's saying is
15:18
there they're kind of I don't know if you want to call them Elites who can work from
15:24
home people like me who have a job that pretty much is all done on the web and then you have the
15:32
other part of the society who are equally important in holding up the
15:38
society and producing food and working in factories and and keeping everything
15:44
we enjoy afloat and there is an unfairness to that and it
15:49
could cause social tension I think is is his perspective on this
15:55
um he he mentioned uh like Emma Amazon and apple want their employees to go
16:01
back to office which is true game companies like blizzard um and you know Microsoft want that as
16:08
well and it's it's kind of a big push to get back to office
16:14
um for employees uh the remote work benefits are obvious and you know that's that's kind of what
16:22
what was said that's like a quick summary of what was said in that now
16:28
my perspective on remote work I know that I have a bias
16:33
but I also understand this point of view I understand the unfairness factor to
16:40
Society of course there's always been uh you know a disparity between say
16:46
programmers who sit and don't have to do much um you know we're not lifting heavy
16:53
weights or heavy things and risking our lives like other people are doing and
16:58
then other people do that and somehow programmers get paid more and it is it
17:03
all comes down to capitalism supply and demand um you know it's it's for example if
17:11
computers just died today I'd probably be able to pick up and learn um construction or something like that
17:17
as long as I'm mobile and able and that's not so easy like if all if
17:23
all the lumber in the world disappeared and all we had were computers it would be much more difficult for someone in
17:29
construction to say take a role that I work in and that's not to say one is harder than the other or anything like
17:35
that it's just that's just how capitalism works it's a supply and demand scenario and it can be
17:42
unfair but you know it's it's created the greatest nation in the world and uh the greatest Prosperity that the world
17:49
has ever seen because we do share a lot of our prosperity so it's unfortunate I have no solution
17:57
I have no opinion on a solution I I'm just a I'm just a family man who wants to feed his kids
18:03
so from the perspective of working from home
18:10
I've worked with a lot of people who work from home for the last couple of years I mean my job all the way up till
18:16
2020 was going to the office and I would take a
18:23
train two hours to get there and two hours back because I wanted to live in a different place than the job was or it
18:29
was way too expensive to live where the job was so I sacrificed four hours of my day five
18:35
days a week just to get to and from work and I I was on trains where people on
18:43
the train before me were attacked by people with machetes and you know I've seen quite a few weird
18:49
things on the train so you know I prefer not to do that
18:55
especially now that I have children so there is like a rah-rah and a lot of
19:01
people who are remote work from home they have this like let's band
19:07
together and not allow it to happen now I would like to say if you could make
19:13
yourself valuable now this is the same thing between programmers so you have a you have a value hierarchy of supply and
19:21
demand within programmers you have programmers who there's a lot of supply and uh you know or yeah there's a lot of
19:30
supply and the demand is met but then you have jobs that are much higher
19:36
difficulty that have a very low supply of programmers and has a very high demand now I would
19:44
argue that if there's a huge supply of programmers for a particular job
19:50
then a company may be in their in their rights to say come into work and that's because you don't really have
19:58
arguing power there you don't you can't fight for your position you can't do something like that now programmers who
20:05
are in much lower Supply let's say their systems programmer game engine programmers those sorts of people
20:13
um you have bargaining power it's hard to find people in that realm and you could
20:20
say hey I'll take a little bit of a pay cut let me work exclusively from home and
20:27
we've got a deal and companies would gladly do that and they even before the
20:32
whole pandemic people would have these companies would have gladly done it I've worked with people who worked remote
20:39
so that I think just on the perspective of remote work there is uh
20:47
you know you don't have a right to just want to do it your way and the reason I say this is because I've worked with a
20:53
lot of programmers who work remote who don't do much of anything uh they I know
20:58
they came in late came in late they push off things they go to a lot of
21:05
meetings and just work doesn't get done and you can tell because timelines get
21:11
pushed all the time and part of that is the hierarchy of the business you know
21:17
management and all that stuff and having too many programmers and that's a whole other thing to to
21:24
look at now one thing I will say is I do miss working in person it is something that I
21:31
do miss I I actually liked going in and the camaraderie and you know making the jokes and eating with the eating with
21:39
the co-workers and talking about code and projects and Concepts and ideas and game designs and hunting and just random
21:47
stuff I do miss that and you know the free lunches were awesome too you get free
21:52
lunch every day those those were great a great incentive so there were definitely huge perks that I
21:59
really miss now as a father I love being at home with my kids so
22:06
working remote is a dream come true I the time that I would spend traveling to
22:12
go to work to come from work can be spent with my children and really
22:18
there's that's there's no there's nothing that compares it's it's the dream so though I do miss the social
22:26
aspect of talking to people and that does um you know as a downside there is an upside to to being with my family
22:34
you gotta pay somewhere you can't get everything for free now people who don't have families I'm sorry but
22:42
you know I would even encourage you to go to work staying at home all day is not good for your mental health if you
22:48
don't have families uh even if you just have a wife and you don't have kids it's not good for you just to be at home all
22:55
day locked in a room same room every day nobody around you that's that's not healthy and I would say try maybe
23:02
you know going into work when they have those uh they have uh pretty much every
23:08
job has open desks for you to go in and work the problem there is if nobody else
23:13
is there then you're just in a bigger room alone and you had to travel to get there so there is kind of an incentive
23:19
in that way for companies to request people to come in to work so that people
23:25
can see each other so that it gives incentive to people who want to come in maybe not all the time to come in
23:32
it's a very difficult situation I understand the perspective as a work from home person who does not want to
23:38
change it because I have children I will say though if I didn't have children I'd be going back to work I
23:45
would actually be going in I would probably get a different job that was closer to me so I didn't spend four hours traveling
23:51
but I would likely go into work because I just I love that social atmosphere of being
23:59
with like-minded people working together that sort of thing it's I just miss it
24:04
so really the only reason I don't is my kids so that's that's kind of
24:12
the two sides of the coin I feel the upsides like I said previously of
24:18
working from home for even for people without kids are obvious uh lower cost of living
24:23
for example I I lived in a high cost area and in 2020 I moved
24:31
back to be with family and just my entire you know extended family were
24:36
really close so by doing that my cost of living went way down and that was a huge
24:44
benefit to me and made it much more comfortable to raise my children and to know that I could provide for
24:50
them a home and everything else so there's just so many benefits from
24:58
working from home but I do get it and employees are not as
25:04
productive as they could be in office this is why if you remember before 2020 wework was booming I think
25:14
it's dead now because of everything that happened but it was booming because people would leave home
25:20
to rent a space in an office even if it was by themselves if they
25:25
were video editors or whatever just because they it made them more productive or maybe it made them feel
25:31
more productive I don't know but it I think going to have a space to
25:36
work at especially with others does make you more productive in general it's a lot easier to talk to people
25:43
now at my last company what we did is we had a Discord Channel and we had a kind
25:48
of a structure that segmented the programmers into five groups and my group would be in Discord all day long
25:55
and we had push to talk so we'd press a button and talk and it was kind of like being in the office because there was a
26:00
lot of banter we made some jokes we we made you know as as employers as employees do with
26:07
each other made inappropriate jokes made it just just had you know shooting the breeze and having a lot of fun but we
26:13
also did of course use that to talk about random problems so there wasn't a
26:20
meeting barrier where we'd have to set up a meeting to talk about something we just press a button say hey yo you know
26:26
I have this problem were you guys seen it you guys know what's going on and they would just respond it's very simple
26:33
uh also meetings I think exploded I don't even want to get into meetings anyone who has a job in programming
26:39
knows meetings are useless I I think this is just to pad the hours of the day
26:44
and people uh they say oh hate meetings but then they they make the meetings go really long
26:51
because they don't want to get back to work you know get back to work they want to
26:57
be able to go into the stand up the next day and say oh you know I had meetings
27:02
for this and that and that and this other meeting and you know meetings all day so it was really hard to get anything done
27:09
um that's that's common it's not as common as my current job my last job super
27:16
common current job I think is a lot more streamlined and they're they're pretty
27:21
effective at kind of managing those meetings at least for me others maybe not but at least for me and the one I
27:28
work at has tons of remote workers they hire tons of people knowing they're out of state even I'm out of state and you
27:36
know everybody on my on the engine team is out of state from the actual office
27:41
so I think they've just they're much more educated and well-versed in how to work
27:48
with uh work with remote people manage the time and get things done so
27:53
it is kind of up to the business if it's a big business it's hard to do that so
27:59
at big businesses you're going to see big businesses calling people in the at the more medium-sized ones uh you know
28:06
or sub Studios you're probably going to see a lot more remote work so that's my
28:12
long rant on remote work and like I said it has
28:18
emotional health uh benefits and negatives I think there's a lot of
28:24
benefits for families people with children I think that there's a lot of negatives for people who are just a look
28:32
you know I don't want to say alone but you know they they're not married or they don't have kids maybe their spouse
28:38
goes somewhere to work or their spouse is just in another room all day I can see there being some you know severe
28:45
downsides people are social we want to talk you know I talked to my son who can't
28:52
really make a full he can't even make a full sentence but there's a lot of social to that and I play with them and
28:57
you know it it's I think I fill my social meter if we're talking about the Sims uh pretty effectively with that so
29:06
yeah that's that's kind of the perspective on remote work if you're a remote worker
29:12
get on hey good for you but uh you know I'm not into the whole rah-rah let's
29:19
rally together and never let us never let them make us uh come into the office ever again
29:25
I think that there are huge benefits to being in the office in a lot of scenarios and you got to
29:32
choose your battles and you've got to have the skills that are worth uh worth
29:38
it to the company to argue for remote work in my opinion so that's that's the perspective on remote
29:44
work all right due to there not being a whole
70 is the new standard
29:50
lot of news today I suppose everybody is talking about Sega raising its price to seventy
29:57
dollars for games now I have heard the argument games have
30:04
been the same price for you know many many years uh-huh I hear you I mean it it has
30:10
raised you know 10 bucks once before and 10 bucks again I hear that argument
30:16
um you know it would be a valid argument if all the methods of distribution were
30:21
exactly the same the difference is that all the methods of distribution have changed a lot of
30:28
people buy digital I would probably think that most people buy digital just
30:33
look at steam sales and those those digital sales still
30:40
being you know full box price um is crazy to me it's crazy that the
30:46
price is so high it's crazy that we're going to seventy dollars we're going to be at like a hundred dollars soon and I
30:52
get that there's inflation and the whole economy thing and you know that's going haywire
30:58
but still the seventy dollars for a game that's a lot of money for people
31:04
and you know you just can you can imagine everybody from you know kids who
31:11
just started working who left their parents house maybe they're they're starting their career and they're
31:17
starting to work and develop their skills they want to go home and play games too and you're kind of limiting
31:23
them to buying one game a year or something like that like one that you can't you can't buy that many AAA games
31:30
at 70 bucks a pop in those scenarios I know because I had a minimum wage job to start and
31:38
I couldn't even buy ice cream so I'd have to in that scenario I'd have to save seventy dollars somehow
31:45
because I had rent and everything else to pay um so I wouldn't even be able to buy AAA
31:50
games I got to wait till they go on sale but then you have companies like Nintendo that just don't go on sale for for whatever reason and since they never
31:57
go on sale and they keep their games at top at their top price even when you want to buy used uh you're paying like
32:05
52 bucks and uh that's that's insane how are you gonna how you gonna play any of these games
32:12
you really want to play in that perspective it's it's unheard of so raising it to 70 that's a ten dollar
32:19
jump and you have digital distribution it does not cost you the same that it
32:25
would cost you to put a box on the Shelf of a store because you have to make all
32:30
that box art you have to produce it you have to publish it you have to work with the warehouses and shipping and
32:36
distribution and overseas shipping and all of that sort of stuff
32:42
you don't have to do that anymore you just click a button and download it and server space is cheap man with you know
32:49
so many Cloud providers competing in the space it's cheapest they're cheap especially when you buy it at scale it's
32:57
incredibly cheap so going up to 70 dollars for games I I feel like
33:03
is it's kind of it's a it's a real shame because I remember myself in that
33:09
scenario and this would have just made it so I couldn't play any games at all I'd have to play like the throwaway
33:17
sports games that everybody has as a game collector and if any of you collect
33:22
games you know exactly what I'm talking about the wall of sports games uh it would be like all you could afford so
33:30
I think another problem uh why the prices have gone up is the same thing with the the companies
33:37
they over staff they over budget they spend way much way
33:42
too much time managing and meetings and planning and jira and tasks and all this
33:48
sort of nonsense uh they they waste so much money and hire
33:54
way too many people to to make a video game and we have you know I can't
33:59
compare games now to games from the 90s where you had like five dudes working on
34:04
it Nintendo and they'd produce a hit title of course games are way more
34:10
complicated now you know there's there's way more to them and there's a lot of higher expectations I get that
34:17
but at the same time you know back then they didn't they had to make their own tools to make it work
34:23
now you've got Unity you've got Unreal Engine you can do a motion capture with
34:29
pretty cheap equipment now it's super cheap to do motion capture to set up a motion capture studio and the studios of
34:36
work that just have one uh and just just to have one or whenever they need it
34:42
it's it's really inexpensive nowadays it's not we're not talking like 50 Grand
34:47
to set up a to set up a mocap Studio people can set up mocap with I remember
34:53
like six or almost yeah six or ten years ago
34:58
somewhere in there people were getting a whole bunch of uh what are they called
35:04
the the Microsoft Connect they're getting a whole bunch of those and you get like three or five of them and you
35:10
can you connect them together and you had mocap basically that you sure had to
35:16
clean up but what mocap don't you have to clean up and you know it's it's way cheaper now so
35:23
it's way cheaper to produce you have all these tools made for you you don't need crazy you don't need an army of engine
35:31
programmers you you just kind of you know you need game programmers and they use the tools that exit pre-exist and
35:38
the engine you have tons of tools from online you've got all the third party
35:45
tools like blender is free even you know Affinity or or Adobe Photoshop and all
35:52
that sort of stuff and you have ai now you have libraries of PBR materials just so much stuff to
36:00
accelerate your process and being a games at least for the last
36:05
in the last company it took us way too many years to develop a game and that's
36:11
because we remade it multiple times because it wasn't feeling right it wasn't hidden kpis
36:16
so in that part it's kind of your problem the business problem
36:22
um to figure out and maybe with less people you would have a more clear Direction so seventy dollars for a game man that's
36:28
that's a tough Bullet To Bite especially for me I'm I can tell you right now
36:34
I have children I'm not going to be spending 70 on a game I will wait until that game goes on sale
36:41
at my local game stores and I will buy it much cheaper or I'll buy it on eBay I
36:47
will not buy top dollar seventy dollar games uh like The Legend of Zelda is out
36:53
right now and I really want to play it first of all I'm about to have a kid so I can't but even so I would much rather
37:01
just wait some number of months to get it at a reasonable price seventy dollars
37:07
is way too much that's that's like how much money I spend at the grocery store
37:13
buying like five things so would I rather eat or would I rather play a game
37:20
I'm gonna I'm gonna choose to eat sorry so hopefully people people fight this and
37:28
they they just I don't know stop buying seventy dollar games or just only buy games on sales or
37:35
third party because that's that's crazy that's crazy towns
37:40
but companies Activision Blizzard Electronic Arts uh take two interactive
37:46
which owns a lot of companies by the way uh Playstation Xbox and even Nintendo
37:53
have all raised their prices and so and Sega now have all raised their prices to seventy dollars and it's a shame uh
38:01
that's that's my opinions on that if you have a strong opinion on it let me know maybe a counter argument and let me know
38:07
why we should be paying seventy dollars rather than companies kind of
38:13
you know fixing their Staffing problem and all their other problems to reduce the cost for them so that they can pass
38:18
those savings on to the consumer that's uh that's my thoughts on that
38:24
all right so I'm going to wrap this up with a couple of shorter things so one
N64 Switch controller in stock
38:31
is the Nintendo 64 controller for the switch is now available I mentioned this because I missed out on it
38:38
last time it sold out I missed out on the Super Nintendo controller and I
38:43
bought both of those just now so um those I I do want to play the emulator
38:50
games on the switch using the controllers I remember from my childhood so that's going to be exciting
38:57
if you if you uh if they're still in stock by the time this goes up tomorrow tomorrow morning
39:03
hopefully you can you can grab one if you also missed it um
Overwatch 2 cancels PVE hero mode
39:08
and another topic that is near and dear to my heart
39:14
is that OverWatch has uh canceled their PVE hero mode and that sucks I mean I
39:22
don't I'm pretty sure that's going to make tons of people angry now I haven't played OverWatch in some number of months now
39:28
uh I I was an avid player I've played it ever since it launched I have the over
39:33
one I have an OverWatch 2 poster that's signed by the developers because I I loved playing it so much even with all
39:40
its quirks and its biases and it's angry uh it's angry players and all those
39:45
sorts of things um I loved OverWatch I love the characters didn't care much about the
39:51
stories that they put out didn't really I don't I'm not super into stories for games I also don't
39:57
uh I don't like it when they retcon a whole bunch of stuff just to to please people
40:04
um so I just didn't pay attention to the story but the gameplay was awesome the character like the way they the the
40:10
different characters were play it was just a lot of fun it was fun to play the characters their character controllers
40:16
are awesome they're networking for some of its flaws was pretty dang good or is
40:23
pretty dang good so I was super hyped about the PVE mode for
40:30
OverWatch I don't know who else was I've played I've played so much like
40:36
competitive matches and arcade modes that I was ready for a PVE mode
40:41
something where you can have a character you can essentially level them up and
40:46
play with other people play with friends randos doesn't matter I thought it would be such a it'd be a lot less toxic if
40:55
you've ever played competitive or any other part of OverWatch you know it's crazy toxic you can be getting along
41:00
with somebody just fine one mistake and it's over they're just pissed they're just gonna yell at you and they're gonna
41:06
screaming and say I said it's all I don't know choose a character they're
41:11
going to blame somebody they always blame somebody else somebody but themselves
41:17
being a team game if you're not being a team player it's probably you but I don't know the
41:24
matches where you clicked with people and you had fun and you know even if
41:29
there were close matches and you lost or whatever and people are still cool about it that's what I liked and it felt really
41:36
good with that and I thought the PVE would be that I thought it would be that experience that I enjoyed so much
41:43
from the online play playing with people who just were having fun and could
41:50
cooperate and we're just enjoying the game and the you know wasn't nobody was
41:56
being toxic I thought that would be it was going to be just amazing so they scrapped that and of course that
42:03
probably means I won't play anytime soon anymore I mean I like I said I haven't been playing for a few months
42:08
but if they said oh PVE is launching in like a month I would be right back into
42:14
OverWatch getting prepared you know after my new kid is born and
42:21
I I man that would have brought me back so fast but man it's just
42:27
I'm so disappointed it's that's the hard part is that I'm not angry I'm just
42:33
disappointed because the game was great and I thought this would be like so awesome you know with all the team
42:40
swapping and stuff they did internally at blizzard I can see how these kinds of things happen being on teams of
42:46
programmers and their develop game developers who've had that sort of thing happen in the past I I get it totally
42:53
get it probably super disa the developers themselves are probably super disappointed at the end of the day it's
42:59
a business they got to make money and the live Services is what makes their money so super disappointed in
43:06
that and uh just so that's a random topic on games and
TLA+ programming language
43:11
now to throw out something for the programmers this is going to be for the
43:16
much more advanced programmers for those of you who are interested in
43:23
multi-threaded applications and verifying your code if you haven't
43:29
used uh it's I guess the language it's a logic checker
43:36
um it's called TLA plus it's been around for quite a while I'm a huge fan of the
43:43
guy who who made it just him personally I can't I can't remember the his name
43:49
off top of my head um I'm gonna have to look it up but he he he worked on he works on
43:58
algorithms he's a mathematician in the background let's see who made TLA plus
44:04
um he so he comes from this uh algorithms
44:11
background and his Focus was primarily on
44:16
a multi-threaded applications or inter inner communication between computer
44:21
parallel Computing Leslie Leslie Lamport how could I forget LL so TLA plus is a
44:29
way for you to check your multi-threaded code I think it's kind of you know the
44:34
root his favorite algorithm that he came up with the root of it is goes back to the bakery algorithm and I'll leave that
44:41
to you to look up it basically has to do with a man going into the bakery and getting a ticket and you know there's a
44:47
bunch of people tickets and and it's like a multi-threading program and it's an algorithm to solve that problem
44:53
but uh TLA plus if you haven't used it you should use it there's a funny story about it he works
45:01
at Microsoft and Microsoft didn't start using it internally rigorously until Amazon published if
45:08
they were using it and was making their web services so much better and if
45:13
you're doing web stuff if you're doing multi-threaded programming check out TLA plus it it does use logic notation
45:21
um from mathematics it's in ASCII form so you know if you're going to do like an
45:28
and or or you've got to use the forward slash backslash to make the shape
45:33
to do the logic but learning logic notation is not that complicated uh just
45:39
look it up on Wikipedia it's pretty short read and I would highly suggest if
45:45
you haven't used TLA plus this is a PSA you don't see a whole lot on it I I would like you to check it out and I'll
45:53
uh I'll put the the link to an article that I saw recently that got me thinking
45:59
about it that kind of talks about the the two-phase pizza party and there's a
46:05
there's a step I think it explains I haven't read through the whole thing but it it looks like it explains uh TLA Plus
46:13
in a basic way to to learn it so I'm going to be posting that in the description I'll put it on the Twitter
46:20
and go check it out if you're in the multi-thread stuff if you're learning multi-threaded stuff if you do web
46:25
things check it out it's going to make your algorithms better and it's going to help you a lot in
46:33
solving problems before they happen lots of problems happen with concurrency on
46:38
the web and this is a great way to solve that so that's it for today I know it was a
Concurrency
46:44
lot of rant about jobs but there's been a lot of things going on about it there's that interview with Elon Musk
46:50
who really got me thinking about it and those are my perspectives on that I'd like to hear your perspectives if you
46:56
have any how you feel I'm sure most of you have been doing remote work as developers and I want to know what you
47:03
think maybe from the perspective of somebody who doesn't have children and
47:08
how you feel about that because I remember I started remote work without children
47:13
and I thought it was the most incredible thing in the world but I don't know what it would be like a few years into it and
47:20
still being you know not flying solo you may have had a girlfriend or wife or whatever but kind
47:26
of that aspect of it I'm really curious on on your perspective on that so let me know anyways have a good one and bye for
47:34
now
