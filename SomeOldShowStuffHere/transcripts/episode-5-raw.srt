1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
Jobs for programmers. Some of us need them, some of us have them. I was curious

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,780
about remote work and how it affects the job market, what companies are doing with

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:19,960
remote work. I work remotely, a lot of you maybe work remotely, and just kind of

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,320
want to take a look at jobs. But before I get into remote work, I want to take a

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:31,080
look at losing jobs. Lots of people are losing jobs. Yet another story, today, not

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,760
today, a couple days ago Stack Overflow lays off 10% of their employees, and

7
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,760
that's not a lot. I was surprised to find out that 10% of the Stack Overflow

8
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:47,600
employee base was 58 employees, which is pretty astounding. I like that they run a

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,400
tight ship over there. I think that having, I mean, that means they've got 580

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,800
employees. I think that may be a little bit too high to run a question-and-answer

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,720
site. I don't know. I don't run a question-and-answer site. I just think

12
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,880
that oftentimes we hire too many developers. We hire way too many people,

13
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,960
and that's usually what is slowing us down at companies interworking with

14
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,480
people. So perhaps they're figuring this out and, you know,

15
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,560
laying off people. I've always said that programming is not an assembly line job.

16
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:34,400
You can't just add more programmers and then all of a sudden magically produce

17
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,320
tons more code. There's been studies of this that show that that's never the

18
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,920
case. You can look at the Mythical Man month from the 70s, and that still holds

19
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,000
true. Believe it or not, they did hire tons of programmers at companies even

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,600
back then when there weren't that many. So just taking a look at something like

21
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:02,040
that, and that information has basically held true this entire time, we can start

22
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,600
to see that you can't just hire more programmers and more developers and

23
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,400
expect things to go faster. That's just not how it works. In fact, I think the

24
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:20,080
CEO of Nintendo, he famously was shown Mother 3. I don't know which one it was.

25
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,360
Mother, the game that has like Ness as the main character. I think it's Ness. I

26
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:35,040
don't know who it is. Kid with baseball cap and the baseball bat. So it's

27
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,280
this RPG, and they presented it to him, and he said this is gonna take

28
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:48,600
forever to fix. And so he said, we can get it done in six months if we start over

29
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,880
from scratch. And that's what they did. They started over from scratch, and I

30
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,200
think it took seven or eight months to complete the game and get it published.

31
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,640
And that just shows you that sometimes having a lot of legacy code, it's easier

32
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,040
just to scrap it all and do it from scratch. And I'm a big proponent of that.

33
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:12,680
However, it's very hard to pull off in this day and age. Anyways, we have... so

34
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,840
Stack Overflow fired or laid off. I don't know. Is that any different than firing? I

35
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,920
think it's the more PC language. But they fired 58 employees, which is 10% of the

36
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:31,680
workforce. They were saying that the CEO of Stack Overflow perhaps, or his name is

37
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:39,520
I can't even pronounce his name. I'll call him PC. That's his initials.

38
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:45,600
Said that layoffs were also a result of taking a hard look at our strategic

39
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,680
priorities this fiscal year and the organizational structure. And that's

40
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,720
usually how it goes. They look and see, oh, we have a lot of bloat. We had a heyday

41
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:03,400
during that pandemic, hired people maybe for things we didn't need. And now

42
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,040
we're kind of overpopulated and slowing ourselves down, just kind of drudging

43
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,800
along. Once the ship gets bigger, it's gonna be harder to push it. So that's

44
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:23,280
essentially, you know, as vague as it is, why let it go? They want to pursue

45
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,560
agility and flexibility with the launch of AI ML focused offerings in the months

46
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,560
ahead. So everybody's going AI, obviously. I think everybody can can look around

47
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,840
and see that. Every company, I mean, most of Google I.O. is just AI. That's the

48
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,080
buzzword. That's what everybody's expecting. It's where all the investors

49
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,440
are going, even though they probably wouldn't have touched it with a 10-foot

50
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:54,760
pole like five years ago. And so Stack Overflow is in jeopardy, honestly. When

51
00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:01,400
you have a, I mean, I think I've seen articles about a dip in their user base

52
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:07,840
ever since like ChatGPT was announced and GitHub Copilot and these kinds of AI

53
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,720
generated code. And I can see why. It's very easy to just write a comment in

54
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,080
your code, say, save a file, and it detects the language and it gives you

55
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,280
basically what you would have went to Stack Overflow for, a little copy and

56
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,040
paste snippet. So I don't know exactly what they're gonna do with artificial

57
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,080
intelligence. I think the only way they can save themselves is if they compete

58
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,680
with things like Copilot and they produce an artificial intelligence that

59
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,960
takes the entire base of knowledge of Stack Overflow and all the suggestions

60
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:47,520
there and kind of works from that. Although Microsoft, you know, they bought

61
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,200
GitHub for a reason and that was to have access to all the code on GitHub,

62
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,840
whether we like it or not, to train their AIs. So they have a much bigger code base

63
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,520
to work from. So that's, you know, just nature of the business. But I

64
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:10,800
don't want to focus too much just on Stack Overflow. Ironically, and this one

65
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,040
is ironic to me because we all know about all the layoffs that are

66
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,400
happening. There's layoffs at every big company you can think of. Games, software,

67
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:29,320
nobody is safe in the software realm. And I don't want to say the funniest, but

68
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:36,000
it is kind of funny. LinkedIn cuts 700 jobs and closes their China app. So I can

69
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,160
understand why they closed their China app. I mean, that's a whole other

70
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:47,960
discussion about, you know, Chinese firewall and kind of their regulatory

71
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,880
stuff that makes it very difficult to do stuff there. So besides the point, but

72
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,520
they cut 700 jobs at LinkedIn. It's ironic because you would imagine with

73
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,080
everybody getting laid off from every big company, there's a lot of people who

74
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,760
are going to be paying for LinkedIn and trying to get jobs. So it's weird to me

75
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:17,600
that a job search website, and I have an article here that says, let's see here,

76
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:24,560
let's take a look. It says more than 197,000 tech sector employees have lost

77
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:31,200
their jobs since the start of 2023. This isn't even talking about 2022. So, you

78
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,000
know, 200,000 people looking for jobs and LinkedIn is, they're cutting, they're

79
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,840
cutting 700 jobs from their company, which does that mean people are not

80
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,720
looking for jobs? Does it mean they're not looking through LinkedIn? Or they

81
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:53,280
just, is LinkedIn just not a viable thing for finding jobs? I don't know what to

82
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,600
take of this. I've gotten jobs through LinkedIn

83
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,520
recruiters, so it's a little strange to me. I think that it's pretty effective.

84
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:08,120
There's a lot of recruiters on there and there's a lot of noise. Daily I get

85
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,360
recruiters hitting me up for jobs. I sometimes feel like I need to close down

86
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,800
my thing whenever I take a job that I'm happy with. But there's a lot of

87
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,760
recruiters and there's, it seems to be a lot of jobs because I, you know, I get them

88
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:30,920
for artificial intelligence, games, mobile apps, just the whole spectrum. So, I don't

89
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:36,400
know. So it's very odd. I don't know what to take of it. I don't know if it's a

90
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,760
good omen, a bad omen that they're cutting jobs, but something to think

91
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:49,520
about. But they're not the only ones. So, it looks like May 3rd, Unity conducts a

92
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,840
third round of layoffs. This is the Unity game engine. If you're not a game

93
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:02,040
developer, that's the one I'm talking about. They've cut something, about

94
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,920
8% of their staff, which is another 600 people getting laid off. And I guess this

95
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,080
is the third round. I have no idea what happened in the first couple of rounds.

96
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:21,080
How many people got laid off in that. So, very interesting. Again, games

97
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:27,640
are doing great right now, but I don't know if it's just the trend. All the big

98
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,240
tech bros are talking to each other at their yacht meetups or whatever rich

99
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,520
people do and saying, hey, look, we can just cut a whole bunch of jobs. Look, Elon

100
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:43,400
Musk did it. He cut Twitter to nothing. And still the thing is running and

101
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:48,520
tons of people are using it and it hasn't totally collapsed. Maybe we

102
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:56,360
can do the same. I don't know. But usually, once one person does it, it really

103
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,960
starts a chain reaction. They all realize, hey, maybe we're bloated. We need to save

104
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:05,320
some money. Inflation is happening. All kinds of weird stuff's happening.

105
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,640
Banks are collapsing. Maybe we should start cutting people to save money. I

106
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:15,440
don't know. But it's very interesting. It's affecting everybody from

107
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,200
games to software to tech companies. The whole spectrum. Even LinkedIn. If

108
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,040
LinkedIn's being hit, then you know everything's being hit. That's the way I

109
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:38,640
see it. I did see something from Times Now News. Amid mass layoffs,

110
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,800
there's a particular IT company, an Indian IT company, that is hiring like

111
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:53,120
1,500 people. That's not unheard of. I actually was fired. I will call it fired,

112
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:59,840
laid off, whatever you want to call it. I was laid off. I was part of a

113
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,400
studio, a game studio, and we were making money. The company was already bought

114
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,840
once and they were about to be bought again. They decided to lean up.

115
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:15,240
What they did was they brought in a bunch of... I don't know if they were... I never

116
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:22,080
asked them. I think they were Russian. They may have been Ukrainian. The guy

117
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,000
that was kind of communicating with them and working with them, he was Russian, so

118
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,120
I don't know what the people on the other end was. They didn't really explain

119
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,120
it much. But after working with them and they got integrated with the team, they

120
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,600
laid off everybody in the United States for that company and offshored

121
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:48,120
everything. So it makes perfect sense that they'd be offshoring. Offshore

122
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:55,480
companies would be hiring tons and tons of new people. That could be

123
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:01,880
exactly what it is. I think that's gonna be unnecessary with all

124
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:07,800
the AI stuff that we're creating because it can do it much more efficiently and

125
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:13,200
you can have one programmer who's a little more effective maybe. He's got

126
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,720
a no code. You can't just hire anybody to just put in prompts for

127
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,480
AI. You've got to have somebody who knows code inside and out. So I guess the

128
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:29,280
upper echelons of coders, your jobs are safe. So don't worry about that. So

129
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:40,600
there's been a lot of layoffs. Intel did more layoffs on May 9th, it looks like. So

130
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:47,640
you've got Intel and Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and just tons of companies

131
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,760
just even this month laying off people. And I think that we're tired of seeing

132
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:58,360
all the headlines because we've seen them basically every month for like a

133
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,000
year but it's still going and that's that's pretty crazy.

134
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,680
Luckily I've not had any problems with this since way back when

135
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,040
and that scenario I was talking about. But it is unfortunate for a lot of

136
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:19,280
people. I don't know how to deal with job security there when you're in a huge

137
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:24,800
company like these some of these big companies, Intel, Microsoft. They'll

138
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,160
probably cut important people not even knowing. They just need

139
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:37,640
big sections to just disappear so that they can kind of reserve their funds.

140
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:42,680
So that's kind of the crazy stuff that's going on and the job stuff. I'm

141
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:48,880
not worried at all. If you're secure in your job you don't have to worry. If

142
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,840
you're a really good programmer and you know many languages and you can go

143
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:57,680
cross-discipline you really don't have to worry. You're gonna be fine.

144
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,640
And if you do get laid off like I said I get tons of stuff in LinkedIn. I

145
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,840
know there's stuff out there for you. So if you are laid off, if you're not,

146
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:14,680
something to think about. Everything's good. That brings us to remote work. So I

147
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:39,240
started thinking about remote work today because...



1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
Elon Musk did a long interview and one of the things that came up with that was remote

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,900
work.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,020
You probably know Elon's point of view on remote work.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:16,500
And you know, I'm somewhat ambivalent to remote work.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:24,660
I think that it has its benefits for those of us like me who have family in a place that's

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:33,220
not so techie and it has its huge downsides which we'll also kind of cover.

7
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:40,340
So kind of what he went over today was he opposes the work from home policies and called

8
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,460
out remote work and said it was morally wrong.

9
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,500
He suggested that work from home policies are fundamentally unfair since every employee

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:56,900
can work from home, pointing to a factory and food workers.

11
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:05,220
So basically what he's saying is there are kind of, I don't know if you want to call

12
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:11,160
them elites, who can work from home, people like me, who have a job that pretty much is

13
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,880
all done on the web.

14
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:21,080
And then you have the other part of the society who are equally important in holding up the

15
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:27,140
society and producing food and working in factories and keeping everything we enjoy

16
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,920
afloat.

17
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,840
And there is an unfairness to that and it could cause social tension, I think, is his

18
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,340
perspective on this.

19
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:45,540
He mentioned Amazon and Apple want their employees to go back to office, which is true.

20
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:52,480
Game companies like Blizzard and Microsoft want that as well.

21
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,120
And it's kind of a big push to get back to office.

22
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,120
For employees, the remote work benefits are obvious.

23
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,560
And that's kind of what was said.

24
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,640
That's like a quick summary of what was said in that.

25
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:18,600
Now my perspective on remote work, I know that I have a bias, but I also understand

26
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,840
this point of view.

27
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,800
I understand the unfairness factor to society.

28
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:31,760
Of course, there's always been a disparity between, say, programmers who sit and don't

29
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,320
have to do much.

30
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,400
We're not lifting heavy weights or heavy things and risking our lives like other people are

31
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,560
doing.

32
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,960
And then other people do that.

33
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,600
And somehow programmers get paid more.

34
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:52,720
And it all comes down to capitalism, supply and demand.

35
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,720
For example, if computers just died today, I'd probably be able to pick up and learn

36
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,800
construction or something like that as long as I'm mobile and able.

37
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,720
And that's not so easy.

38
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,000
If all the lumber in the world disappeared and all we had were computers, it would be

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,200
much more difficult for someone in construction to take a role that I work in.

40
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,120
And that's not to say one is harder than the other or anything like that.

41
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,080
That's just how capitalism works.

42
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,520
It's a supply and demand scenario.

43
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:30,400
And it can be unfair, but it's created the greatest nation in the world and the greatest

44
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,880
prosperity that the world has ever seen because we do share a lot of our prosperity.

45
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,160
So it's unfortunate.

46
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,760
I have no solution.

47
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,120
I have no opinion on a solution.

48
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,120
I'm just a family man who wants to feed his kids.

49
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:54,600
So from the perspective of working from home, I've worked with a lot of people who work

50
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,480
from home for the last couple of years.

51
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:05,760
I mean, my job all the way up till 2020 was going to the office and I would take a train

52
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,560
two hours to get there and two hours back because I wanted to live in a different place

53
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,140
than the job was or it was way too expensive to live where the job was.

54
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:21,280
So I sacrificed four hours of my day, five days a week just to get to and from work.

55
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:29,880
And I was on trains where people on the train before me were attacked by people with machetes.

56
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,320
And I've seen quite a few weird things on the train.

57
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:39,940
So I prefer not to do that, especially now that I have children.

58
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:49,080
So there is like a rah-rah and a lot of people who are remote work, working from home, they

59
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,920
have this like, let's band together and not allow it to happen.

60
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,080
Now I would like to say if you could make yourself valuable.

61
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,480
Now this is the same thing between programmers.

62
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:05,840
So you have a value hierarchy of supply and demand within programmers.

63
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:14,400
You have programmers who there's a lot of supply and the demand is met.

64
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:21,240
But then you have jobs that are much higher difficulty that have a very low supply of

65
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,920
programmers and has a very high demand.

66
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:33,400
Now I would argue that if there's a huge supply of programmers for a particular job, then

67
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,360
a company may be in their rights to say, come into work.

68
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,740
And that's because you don't really have arguing power there.

69
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,480
You don't, you can't fight for your position.

70
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,740
You can't do something like that.

71
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:52,520
Now programmers who are in much lower supply, let's say they're a systems programmer, game

72
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:59,100
engine programmers, those sorts of people, you have bargaining power.

73
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,640
It's hard to find people in that realm.

74
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,200
And you could say, hey, I'll take a little bit of a pay cut.

75
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,240
Let me work exclusively from home.

76
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,040
And we've got a deal.

77
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,880
And companies would gladly do that.

78
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:19,120
And they even before the whole pandemic, people would have, companies would have gladly done

79
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,120
it.

80
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,460
I've worked with people who worked remote.

81
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:31,320
So I think just on the perspective of remote work, there is, you know, you don't have a

82
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,400
right to just want to do it your way.

83
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,120
And the reason I say this is because I've worked with a lot of programmers who work

84
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,040
remote who don't do much of anything.

85
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:45,800
They, I know they came in late, came in late.

86
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
They push off things.

87
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,720
They go to a lot of meetings and just work doesn't get done.

88
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,960
And you can tell because timelines get pushed all the time.

89
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:01,680
And part of that is the hierarchy of the business, you know, management and all that stuff and

90
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,080
having too many programmers.

91
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:08,760
And that's a whole other thing to, to, to look at.

92
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:13,320
Now one thing I will say is I do miss working in person.

93
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,880
It is something that I do miss.

94
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,280
I actually liked going in and the camaraderie and, you know, making the jokes and eating

95
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:26,080
with the, eating with the coworkers and talking about code and projects and concepts and ideas

96
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,560
and game designs and hunting and just random stuff.

97
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,560
I do miss that.

98
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,800
And, you know, the free lunches were awesome too.

99
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,840
You get free lunch every day.

100
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,360
Those, those were great, a great incentive.

101
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,360
So there were definitely huge perks that I really miss.

102
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,180
Now as a father, I love being at home with my kids.

103
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,680
So working remote is a dream come true.

104
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,960
I, the time that I would spend traveling to go to work to come from work can be spent

105
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,720
with my children.

106
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:05,200
And really there's, that's, there's no, there's nothing that compares.

107
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,520
It's it's the dream.

108
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:12,880
So though I do miss the social aspect of talking to people and that does, you know, is a downside.

109
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,920
There is an upside to being with my family.

110
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,520
You gotta pay somewhere.

111
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,240
You can't get everything for free.

112
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,600
Now people who don't have families, I'm sorry, but you know, I would even encourage you to

113
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
go to work.

114
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,260
Staying at home all day is not good for your mental health.

115
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:35,120
If you don't have families, even if you just have a wife and you don't have kids, it's

116
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,000
not good for you just to be at home all day, locked in a room, same room every day, nobody

117
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,440
around you.

118
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,840
That's that's not healthy.

119
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:49,280
And I would say try maybe, you know, going into work when they have those, uh, they have,

120
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,560
uh, pretty much every job has open desks for you to go in and work.

121
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,040
The problem there is if nobody else is there, then you're just in a bigger room alone and

122
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,800
you had to travel to get there.

123
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:05,680
So there is kind of an incentive in that way for companies to request people to come into

124
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:11,500
work so that people can see each other so that it gives incentive to people who want

125
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,460
to come in, maybe not all the time to come in.

126
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,920
It's a very difficult situation.

127
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,320
I understand the perspective as a work from home person who does not want to change it

128
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,160
because I have children.

129
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,920
I will say though, if I didn't have children, I'd be going back to work.

130
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,400
I would actually be going in.

131
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,960
I would probably get a different job that was closer to me.

132
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:37,760
So I didn't spend four hours traveling, but I would likely go into work, uh, because I

133
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:44,920
just, I love that social atmosphere of being with like-minded people working together,

134
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,920
that sort of thing.

135
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,040
It's, I just miss it.

136
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,200
So really the only reason I don't is my kids.

137
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,420
So that's, that's kind of the two sides of the coin.

138
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:01,960
I feel the upsides, like I said previously of working from home for, even for people

139
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:07,000
without kids are obvious, uh, lower cost of living.

140
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,480
For example, I lived in a high cost area and in 2020 I moved back to be with family and

141
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,520
just my entire, you know, extended family, uh, were really close.

142
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:27,640
So by doing that, my cost of living went way down and that was a huge benefit to me and

143
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,560
made it much more comfortable to raise my children.

144
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,360
Um, and to know that I could provide for them a home and everything else.

145
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:42,480
So there's just so many benefits from working from home.

146
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:50,680
Um, but I do get it and employees are not as productive as they could be in office.

147
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:56,400
This is why, if you remember before 2020, um, we work was booming.

148
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,200
I think it's dead now because of everything that happened, but it was booming because

149
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:08,160
people would leave home to rent a space in an office, even if it was by themselves, if

150
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,320
they're video editors or whatever, just because they made them more productive or maybe it

151
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,480
made them feel more productive.

152
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:21,080
I don't know, but I think going to have a space to work at, especially with others does

153
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,480
make you more productive in general.

154
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,840
It's a lot easier to talk to people.

155
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,760
Now at my last company, what we did is we had a discord channel and we had a, uh, kind

156
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,240
of a structure that segmented the programmers into five groups.

157
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,800
And my group would be in discord all day long and we had pushed to talk.

158
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,280
So we'd press a button and talk.

159
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,800
And it was kind of like being in the office because there was a lot of banter.

160
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,240
We made some jokes.

161
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:51,320
We made, you know, as, as employer, as employees do with each other, made inappropriate jokes,

162
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,560
made, uh, just, just had, you know, shooting the breeze and having a lot of fun.

163
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,380
But we also did of course, use that to talk about random problems.

164
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:06,400
So there wasn't a meeting barrier, uh, where we'd have to set up a meeting to talk about

165
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
something.

166
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,280
We just press a button and say, Hey, yo, you know, I have this problem.

167
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,440
You guys seen it, you guys know what's going on.

168
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
And they would just respond.

169
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,280
It was very simple.

170
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,000
Uh, also meetings, I think exploded.

171
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,920
I don't even want to get into meetings.

172
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,200
Anyone who has a job in programming knows meetings are useless.

173
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:30,300
Uh, I think it's just a pad the hours of the day and people, uh, they say, oh, I hate meetings

174
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:35,080
but then the, they make the meetings go really long because they don't want to get back to

175
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,080
work.

176
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,840
Uh, you know, get back to work.

177
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:44,680
Uh, they want to be able to go into the standup the next day and say, oh, you know, I had

178
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,360
meetings for this and that and that and this other meeting and, you know, meetings all

179
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
day.

180
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,080
So it was really hard to get anything done.

181
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,920
Um, that's, that's common.

182
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,040
It's not as common as my current job.

183
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,560
My last job, super common.

184
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:05,640
Their job I think is a lot more, um, streamlined and they're, they're pretty effective at kind

185
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,760
of managing those meetings, at least for me, others maybe not, but at least for me and

186
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,140
the one I work at has tons of remote workers.

187
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,760
They hire tons of people knowing they're out of state.

188
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:22,920
Even, uh, I'm out of state and you know, everybody on my, on the engine team is out of state

189
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,920
from the actual office.

190
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:30,920
So I think they've just, they're much more educated and well-versed in how to work with,

191
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,940
uh, work with remote people, manage the time and get things done.

192
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,920
So it is kind of up to the business.

193
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,000
If it's a big business, it's hard to do that.

194
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So at big businesses, you're going to see big businesses calling people in the, at the

195
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,400
more medium sized ones, uh, you know, or sub studios, you're probably going to see a lot

196
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,960
more remote work.

197
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:58,200
So that's my long rant on remote work.

198
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:06,160
And like I said, it has emotional health, uh, benefits and negatives.

199
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,080
I think there's a lot of benefits for families, people with children.

200
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:15,200
I think that there's a lot of negatives for people who are just, you know, I don't want

201
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,840
to say alone, but you know, they, they're not married or they don't have kids.

202
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,240
Maybe their spouse goes somewhere else to work or their spouse is just in another room

203
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,240
all day.

204
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,120
I can see there being some, you know, severe downsides.

205
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,120
People are social.

206
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,120
We want to talk.

207
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:36,480
Um, you know, I talked to my son who can't really make a full, he can't even make a full

208
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,200
sentence, but there's a lot of social to that.

209
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,640
And I play with him and you know, it it's, I think I fill my social meter if we're talking

210
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,040
about the Sims, uh, pretty effectively with that.

211
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,440
So yeah, that's, that's kind of the perspective on remote work.

212
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,640
If you're a remote worker, get on a good for you.

213
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:02,480
But um, you know, I'm, I'm not into the whole rah, rah, let's rally together and never let

214
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,600
a, never let them make us, uh, come into the office ever again.

215
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,680
I think that there are huge benefits to be in the office, um, and a lot of scenarios

216
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,520
and a, you got to choose your battles and you've got to have the skills that are worth,

217
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,640
uh, worth it to the company to argue for remote work in my opinion.

218
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:44,640
So that's, that's the perspective on remote work.



1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
Alright, due to there not being a whole lot of news today I suppose, everybody is talking

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,160
about Sega raising its price to $70 for games.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:21,440
Now I have heard the argument, games have been the same price for many many years.

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,560
Uh huh, I hear ya.

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:31,440
I mean it has raised $10 once before and $10 again, I hear that argument.

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:38,000
It would be a valid argument if all the methods of distribution were exactly the same.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,280
The difference is that all the methods of distribution have changed.

8
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,920
A lot of people buy digital.

9
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,040
I would probably think that most people buy digital.

10
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:59,000
Just look at Steam sales and those digital sales still being full box price is crazy

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
to me.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,760
It's crazy that the price is so high.

13
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,560
It's crazy that we're going to $70, we're going to be at like $100 soon.

14
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:14,880
I get that there's inflation and the whole economy thing that's going haywire, but still

15
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,320
the $70 for a game, that's a lot of money for people.

16
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:28,720
You can imagine everybody from kids who just started working, who left their parents' house,

17
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,320
maybe they're starting their career and they're starting to work and develop their skills,

18
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,840
they want to go home and play games too.

19
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,240
You're kind of limiting them to buying one game a year or something like that.

20
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,000
You can't buy that many AAA games at $70 a pop in those scenarios.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I know because I had a minimum wage job to start and I couldn't even buy ice cream.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,320
So in that scenario I'd have to save $70 somehow because I had rent and everything else to

23
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,960
pay so I wouldn't even be able to buy AAA games.

24
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,400
I've got to wait until they go on sale.

25
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,160
But then you have companies like Nintendo that just don't go on sale for whatever reason.

26
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,400
And since they never go on sale and they keep their games at their top price, even when

27
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,480
you want to buy used, you're paying like $52.

28
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,480
That's insane.

29
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:29,000
How are you going to play any of these games you really want to play in that perspective?

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,200
It's unheard of.

31
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,680
So raising it to $70, that's a $10 jump.

32
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,200
You have digital distribution.

33
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,800
It does not cost you the same that it would cost you to put a box on the shelf of a store

34
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,680
because you have to make all that box art, you have to produce it, you have to publish

35
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,480
it, you have to work with the warehouses and shipping and distribution and overseas shipping

36
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,700
and all of that sort of stuff.

37
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,760
You don't have to do that anymore.

38
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,080
You just click a button and download it.

39
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,000
And server space is cheap, man.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,760
So many cloud providers competing in the space, it's cheap.

41
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,760
They're cheap.

42
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,960
Especially when you buy it at scale, it's incredibly cheap.

43
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:23,720
So going up to $70 for games, I feel like it's a real shame because I remember myself

44
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,280
in that scenario and this would have just made it so I couldn't play any games at all.

45
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,200
I'd have to play like the throwaway sports games that everybody has.

46
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,760
As a game collector, and if any of you collect games, you know exactly what I'm talking about,

47
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,320
the wall of sports games would be like all you could afford.

48
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:51,920
So I think another problem why the prices have gone up is the same thing with the companies.

49
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,800
They overstaff.

50
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,200
They over budget.

51
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:02,240
They spend way too much time managing and meetings and planning and JIRA and tasks and

52
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,080
all this sort of nonsense.

53
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:13,560
They waste so much money and hire way too many people to make a video game.

54
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,960
I can't compare games now to games from the 90s where you had like five dudes working

55
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,840
on it at Nintendo and they'd produce a hit title.

56
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,000
Of course, games are way more complicated now.

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,840
There's way more to them and there's a lot of higher expectations.

58
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,440
I get that.

59
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:38,420
But at the same time, back then they had to make their own tools to make it work.

60
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:44,560
Now you've got Unity, you've got Unreal Engine, you can do motion capture with pretty cheap

61
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
equipment now.

62
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,360
It's super cheap to do motion capture, to set up a motion capture studio.

63
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:57,680
Studios that work that just have one and just to have one or whenever they need it.

64
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,000
It's really inexpensive nowadays.

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,280
We're not talking like 50 grand to set up a mocap studio.

66
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:12,960
People can set up mocap with, I remember like six or almost, yeah, six or ten years ago,

67
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:20,560
somewhere in there, people were getting a whole bunch of, what are they called, the

68
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,560
Microsoft Kinect.

69
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,080
They're getting a whole bunch of those and you get like three or five of them and you

70
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,920
connect them together.

71
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:32,360
And you had a mocap basically that you sure had to clean up, but what mocap don't you

72
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,200
have to clean up?

73
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,920
And it's way cheaper now.

74
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,800
So it's way cheaper to produce.

75
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,520
You have all these tools made for you.

76
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,440
You don't need crazy, you don't need an army of engine programmers.

77
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,320
You just kind of, you know, you need game programmers and they use the tools that pre-exist

78
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,960
in the engine.

79
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,200
You have tons of tools from online.

80
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,320
You've got all the third party tools like Blender is free even.

81
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,320
You have Affinity or Adobe Photoshop and all that sort of stuff.

82
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,920
And you have AI now.

83
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,120
You have libraries of PBR materials.

84
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,760
Just so much stuff to accelerate your process.

85
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:24,880
Being in games, at least in the last company, it took us way too many years to develop a

86
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,920
game and that's because we remade it multiple times because it wasn't feeling right.

87
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,100
It wasn't hitting the KPIs.

88
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:37,200
So in that part, it's kind of your problem, the business problem to figure out.

89
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,880
And maybe with less people, you would have a more clear direction.

90
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:47,000
So $70 for a game, man, that's a tough bullet to bite, especially for me.

91
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,080
I can tell you right now, I have children.

92
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,160
I'm not going to be spending $70 on a game.

93
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:59,800
I will wait until that game goes on sale at my local game stores and I will buy it much

94
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,440
cheaper or I'll buy it on eBay.

95
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,380
I will not buy top dollar, $70 games.

96
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,640
Like the Legend of Zelda is out right now and I really want to play it.

97
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,280
First of all, I'm about to have a kid, so I can't.

98
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:20,240
But even so, I would much rather just wait some number of months to get it at a reasonable

99
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,240
price.

100
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,640
$70 is way too much.

101
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,800
That's like how much money I spend at the grocery store buying like five things.

102
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,160
So would I rather eat or would I rather play a game?

103
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,160
I'm going to choose to eat, sorry.

104
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:48,600
So hopefully people fight this and they just, I don't know, stop buying $70 games or just

105
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,640
only buy games on sales or third party because that's crazy.

106
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,880
That's crazy towns.

107
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:01,360
But companies Activision, Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Take-Two Interactive, which owns a lot

108
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:08,720
of companies by the way, PlayStation, Xbox, and even Nintendo have all raised their prices

109
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:16,200
and so and Sega now have all raised their prices to $70 and it's a shame.

110
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,440
That's my opinions on that.

111
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,280
If you have a strong opinion on it, let me know.

112
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,320
Maybe a counter argument and let me know why we should be paying $70 rather than companies

113
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:31,400
kind of fixing their staffing problem and all their other problems to reduce the cost

114
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:36,480
for them so that they can pass those savings on to the consumer.

115
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,880
That's my thoughts on that.

116
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:44,860
All right, so I'm going to wrap this up with a couple of shorter things.

117
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,640
So one is the Nintendo 64 controller for the Switch is now available.

118
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,280
I mention this because I missed out on it last time it sold out.

119
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:59,280
I missed out on the Super Nintendo controller and I bought both of those just now.

120
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:08,240
So I do want to play the emulator games on the Switch using the controllers I remember

121
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,440
from my childhood.

122
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,320
So that's going to be exciting.

123
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,340
If they're still in stock by the time this goes up tomorrow, tomorrow morning, hopefully

124
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:23,320
you can grab one if you also missed it.

125
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:31,880
And another topic that is near and dear to my heart is that Overwatch has canceled their

126
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,440
PvE hero mode.

127
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,840
And that sucks.

128
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,920
I mean, I'm pretty sure that's going to make tons of people angry.

129
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,800
Now, I haven't played Overwatch in some number of months now.

130
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,160
I was an avid player.

131
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,080
I've played it ever since it launched.

132
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:53,180
I have an Overwatch 2 poster that's signed by the developers because I loved playing

133
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:59,920
it so much, even with all its quirks and its biases and its angry players and all of those

134
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,840
sorts of things.

135
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
I loved Overwatch.

136
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,840
I loved the characters.

137
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,760
Didn't care much about the stories that they put out.

138
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,400
I'm not super into stories for games.

139
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:19,100
I also don't like it when they retcon a whole bunch of stuff just to please people.

140
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,320
So I just didn't pay attention to the story, but the gameplay was awesome.

141
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,560
The character, like the way the different characters would play, it was just a lot of

142
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,560
fun.

143
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,680
It was fun to play the characters.

144
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,880
Their character controllers were awesome.

145
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:38,640
Their networking, for some of its flaws, was pretty dang good, or is pretty dang good.

146
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:45,160
So I was super hyped about the PvE mode for Overwatch.

147
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,000
I don't know who else was.

148
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,080
I've played so much competitive matches and arcade modes that I was ready for a PvE mode,

149
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,960
something where you can have a character, you can essentially level them up, play with

150
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,400
other people, play with friends, randos, doesn't matter.

151
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,200
I thought it would be a lot less toxic.

152
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,840
If you've ever played competitive or any other part of Overwatch, you know it's crazy toxic.

153
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,920
You can be getting along with somebody just fine, one mistake and it's over.

154
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,920
They're just pissed.

155
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,280
They're just going to yell at you and they're going to scream and they're going to say,

156
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,960
it's all, I don't know, choose a character.

157
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,560
They're going to blame somebody.

158
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,760
They always blame somebody else, somebody but themselves.

159
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,520
Being a team game, if you're not being a team player, it's probably you.

160
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:44,280
But I don't know, the matches where you clicked with people and you had fun, and even if they

161
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,840
were close matches and you lost or whatever and people were still cool about it, that's

162
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,320
what I liked and it felt really good with that.

163
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,400
And I thought the PvE would be that.

164
00:11:53,400 --> 00:12:00,240
I thought it would be that experience that I enjoyed so much from the online play, playing

165
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:08,480
with people who just were having fun and could cooperate and were just enjoying the game

166
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,280
and nobody was being toxic.

167
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,480
I thought that was going to be just amazing.

168
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,960
So they scrapped that and of course that probably means I won't play anytime soon anymore.

169
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,520
Like I said, I haven't been playing for a few months, but if they said, oh, PvE is launching

170
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:34,440
in a month, I would be right back into Overwatch, getting prepared after my new kid is born.

171
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:45,440
And man, that would have brought me back so fast, but man, it's just, I'm so disappointed.

172
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,560
That's the hard part is that I'm not angry.

173
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:53,960
I'm just disappointed because the game was great and I thought this would be so awesome.

174
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,840
You know, with all the team swapping and stuff they did internally at Blizzard, I can see

175
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,760
how these kinds of things happen.

176
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,440
Being on teams of programmers and game developers who've had that sort of thing happen in the

177
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,520
past, I get it.

178
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,520
Totally get it.

179
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,800
The developers themselves are probably super disappointed.

180
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,320
At the end of the day, it's a business, they've got to make money.

181
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,840
And the live services is what makes their money.

182
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,800
So super disappointed in that.

183
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,700
So that's a random topic on games.

184
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,080
And now to throw out something for the programmers.

185
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:36,880
This is going to be for the much more advanced programmers, for those of you who are interested

186
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:43,040
in multi-threaded applications and verifying your code.

187
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:53,520
If you haven't used, I guess it's a language, it's a logic checker, it's called TLA+, it's

188
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,280
been around for quite a while.

189
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,560
I'm a huge fan of the guy who made it.

190
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,200
Just him personally.

191
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,000
I can't remember his name off the top of my head.

192
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,600
I'm going to have to look it up.

193
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,600
But he works on algorithms.

194
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,680
He's a mathematician in the background.

195
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:21,480
Let's see, who made TLA+.

196
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,960
So he comes from this algorithms background.

197
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:35,800
And his focus was primarily on multi-threaded applications or intercommunication between

198
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,640
computers, parallel computing.

199
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,880
Leslie Lamport, how could I forget?

200
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,980
LL.

201
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:46,760
So TLA is a way for you to check your multi-threaded code.

202
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:52,200
I think it's kind of the root, his favorite algorithm that he came up with, the root of

203
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,440
it goes back to the bakery algorithm.

204
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,720
And I'll leave that to you to look up.

205
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,760
It basically has to do with a man going into the bakery and getting a ticket.

206
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,520
And there's a bunch of people with tickets and it's like a multi-threading program.

207
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,480
And it's an algorithm to solve that problem.

208
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,680
But TLA+, if you haven't used it, you should use it.

209
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,160
There's a funny story about it.

210
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:20,960
He works at Microsoft and Microsoft didn't start using it internally, rigorously until

211
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:27,720
Amazon published that they were using it and was making their web services so much better.

212
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:33,280
And if you're doing web stuff, if you're doing multi-threaded programming, check out TLA+.

213
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:38,580
It does use logic notation from mathematics.

214
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,960
It's in ASCII form.

215
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:45,160
So if you're going to do like an and or or, you've got to use the forward slash, back

216
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:50,180
slash to make the shape to do the logic.

217
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,960
But learning logic notation is not that complicated.

218
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,040
Just look it up on Wikipedia.

219
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,520
It's a pretty short read.

220
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:03,200
And I would highly suggest if you haven't used TLA+, this is a PSA, you don't see a

221
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
whole lot on it.

222
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,000
I would like you to check it out.

223
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:15,520
And I'll put the link to an article that I saw recently that got me thinking about it

224
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,280
that kind of talks about the two-phase pizza party.

225
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:24,920
And there's a step, I think it explains, I haven't read through the whole thing, but

226
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:30,560
it looks like it explains TLA+, in a basic way, to learn it.

227
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,200
So I'm going to be posting that in the description.

228
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,600
I'll put it on the Twitter, and go check it out if you're into multithreaded stuff, if

229
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,840
you're learning multithreaded stuff, if you do web things, check it out.

230
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:48,040
It's going to make your algorithms better, and it's going to help you a lot in solving

231
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,200
problems before they happen.

232
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,840
Lots of problems happen with concurrency on the web, and this is a great way to solve

233
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,000
that.

234
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,560
So that's it for today.

235
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:02,720
I know it was a lot of rant about jobs, but there's been a lot of things going on about

236
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,720
it.

237
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,560
There was that interview with Elon Musk, it really got me thinking about it.

238
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,000
And those are my perspectives on that.

239
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,920
I'd like to hear your perspectives, if you have any, how you feel.

240
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:17,160
I'm sure most of you have been doing remote work as developers, and I want to know what

241
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:23,520
you think, maybe from the perspective of somebody who doesn't have children, and how you feel

242
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,800
about that.

243
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,520
Because I remember I started remote work without children, and I thought it was the most incredible

244
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,160
thing in the world, but I don't know what it would be like a few years into it, and

245
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,320
still being, you know, not flying solo.

246
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,400
You may have had a girlfriend or wife or whatever, but kind of that aspect of it.

247
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,680
I'm really curious on your perspective on that, so let me know.

248
00:17:45,680 --> 00:18:00,960
Anyways, have a good one, and bye for now.
