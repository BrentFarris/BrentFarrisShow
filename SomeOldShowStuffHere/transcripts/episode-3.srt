00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Welcome back! Today we're one step closer to Microsoft buying Blizzard. Some new C stuff,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,520
I got a PHP note, we got, there's a lot of stuff about programmer health and some other

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:20,520
stuff to go over today. So, I guess the first big story that happened today was Microsoft

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:27,280
is one step closer to buying Blizzard. Of course this is all part of the industry consolidation

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:34,280
that everyone's talking about for the game industry. And it's part of, I think it's related

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:41,600
to something I mentioned before which is we have an issue where a lot of stuff, there's

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,640
just a lot of games being published out to Steam and app stores on both iOS and Android

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:54,040
and a lot now even on the Nintendo Switch which used to be a really walled off garden.

9
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:00,960
And with all that noise it's really hard for people to punch through it and become successful.

10
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,600
A lot of them have to go through YouTubers and YouTubers have a very specific show to

11
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,600
put on. So a lot of games are being kind of developed in a way that YouTubers can use

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,880
them to be funny or entertaining. And so we've got a lot of noise in that at respect. There's

13
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:27,680
a lot of games that are getting published with Unity Asset Store stuff. They just pull

14
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,040
some stuff off the Asset Store they pay a few bucks for, throw it all together, do some

15
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,480
very light coding and then they put out a game in less than a week. And sometimes they're

16
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:45,360
really successful on YouTube. There's a lot of channels out there constantly looking for

17
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,800
more content and games to play that are different and so that constant stream is really nice.

18
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,680
That being said, that makes for a lot of noise in the game industry. Lots and lots of noise

19
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:03,680
on all platforms. We have a lot of adult games coming out of nowhere. My wife complains a

20
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,920
lot about how many adult games she's getting on Steam even though she has so many filters

21
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,080
to block them. They keep coming through. I think it's kind of the joke now. Everybody

22
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:20,080
kind of sees that. So with all that madness, big companies, they have the money to push

23
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,880
their games, to push their products. They can market to millions of people. They have

24
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:31,320
hundreds of millions of dollars to put into marketing and research and influencer campaigns,

25
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:38,320
lots of influencer campaigns. A lot of streamers are paid to pay the games to promote them.

26
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,360
And sometimes, I don't know if the streamers even mention that they are paid to promote

27
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,880
them and if they do it's probably at the beginning of the stream and a lot of people aren't

28
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,920
there for that so they just think that the streamers playing this game that they really

29
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,360
just found and enjoyed when those streamers are paid a ton of money to stream. I know

30
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,200
this because I've worked with companies that do those kinds of campaigns. And they're a

31
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,240
valid marketing campaign because you can get a lot of people to play your game using this

32
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,680
technique.

33
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,280
So how does that relate to Microsoft buying Blizzard and consolidating of the game industry?

34
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,880
Well, like I said in some previous videos, these companies are able to spend millions

35
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,080
and millions of dollars to get eyeballs on their games, to buy their games and they make

36
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,520
tons of money. And all the little companies that can't compete with that wealth have a

37
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,800
very hard time even with really incredible games. There's a lot of incredible games that

38
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:43,800
just nobody ever hears of or that never can get completed because they can't get the funding.

39
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:49,680
So, these big companies get bigger. They spend a lot of money to make a lot of money and

40
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,880
then they spend that money to buy up all the other medium-sized businesses. I think every

41
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:01,200
company I've worked at for the last three companies, all three of them were purchased

42
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,360
by a much larger company and one of them got purchased twice by a large company. So, it's

43
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,280
a very real thing, the consolidation of all these companies.

44
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:18,280
So the European Commission has approved Microsoft's Blizzard purchase. Some other European country,

45
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,400
I don't know what it was, probably England or something, denied it. But there's, I don't

46
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,200
know how this works, but it still goes through and they're still going to be working towards

47
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:35,880
it. I am frankly a little bit ambivalent to big companies buying up other big companies

48
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:42,880
or big companies buying up medium-sized companies. It's a great way for developers, if they get

49
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,320
equity in a medium-sized company, it's a great way to get an extra paycheck. And it's kind

50
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,240
of just the way the system is, what can we do? We can't tell people to stop developing

51
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,640
indie games or we can't make them promise that they'll spend more than a week on an

52
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:05,640
indie game before they publish it to Steam or any other game store. So, just getting

53
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,760
past that noise is already a high bar. Even if you do a Kickstarter campaign, a lot of

54
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,800
the times your game has to be some kind of meme to just stand out and punch through all

55
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,640
that noise. And that can be frustrating for people who don't want to make meme games.

56
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,480
They want to make games that maybe tell a story that means something to them or make

57
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:33,480
a game that's a story for children or they want to make a game that's more puzzle-related

58
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,720
but there's no gimmick and it's just a bunch of series of different kinds of puzzles, that

59
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,160
sort of stuff. And those developers are basically developing games for themselves and their

60
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:49,160
friends because it's a hard market to compete with. Like I said, I'm ambivalent to big companies

61
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:54,820
buying up other big companies. I think the consolidation just happens. Maybe it'll lead

62
00:05:54,820 --> 00:06:01,820
to some kind of tipping point where people get tired of it. Maybe developers will get

63
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,840
tired of making stuff. Of course, then we get into the whole AI stuff and then putting

64
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:13,840
AI into games for really quick and easy content. So, I don't know. It could be noisy forever.

65
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,720
Maybe we can band together, all of us game developers who spend a good quality amount

66
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:25,720
of time on our games. There's a lot of us. So, if we got together and bought and sold

67
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:32,920
each other's games and kind of collaborated in that way to create our own kind of group

68
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,160
marketing strategy in that way, maybe that's the way we can punch through with great game

69
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:44,160
ideas and stop leaving it just to the big guys to be able to get their games out there.

70
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:51,160
So, beyond this kind of business news, the next thing I want to talk about is C. C is

71
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:04,920
my favorite language. I love C++. I love C Sharp. I love JavaScript. Python I'm okay

72
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:11,920
with. I'm learning the Python variant in Godot. I've used Python for over a decade now. It's

73
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,280
not one of my favorites, but mainly because of the whole tabbing thing and spacing and

74
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:27,280
all that sort of stuff. But it's a lot different than it was back then. So, I give it some

75
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:34,280
credit. Anyways, back to C. We got some great news for some C people. GCC 13 now supports

76
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:42,600
C2X stuff. And some of the notable things that people like to point out is null pointer,

77
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:49,200
which comes from C++. That one I'm iffy about. It doesn't really matter to me. I'm fine with

78
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:55,000
null. This null pointer makes it a little bit more explicit, better compiler support,

79
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,480
that sort of stuff. It's not just a macro that evaluates to zero. So, that will allow

80
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:07,480
some better compiler checking for things like that. Enhanced enums. Oh, also for null pointer,

81
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:14,960
not only for compilers, but kind of, what are they called? Static analysis tools will

82
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:22,660
have, you know, they won't have to deal with evaluating macros by name to figure out what

83
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:27,280
the context is that people are doing. So, there are some benefits there for the static

84
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:34,280
analysis and the compilers. Enhanced enumerations. If you've used enum, you know that it evaluates

85
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:41,300
to an int. An int on a 16-bit system is going to be different than a 32. 32 and 64 are basically

86
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:50,200
the same. Int evaluates to 32 bits. But it's ambiguous, right? That's why we have stdint.h,

87
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:57,200
which allows us to use very specific sizes for our integers, like int32t, uint32t, and

88
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:07,880
all that sort of stuff. So, the enhanced enumerations, if I recall correctly, allow you to put a

89
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,000
colon and then put the size of the enum. You see this a lot, like in Unreal Engine, whenever

90
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,000
they're doing enums. It's not like in C++, the class enum stuff. This is just allowing

91
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,960
enums to be a little bit safer in that way and adhere to a proper ABI. Because if you

92
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,580
put an enum instead of a struct and then you compile it on two different systems, you can't

93
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:37,320
guarantee, or two different compilers even, you can't guarantee that you're going to wind

94
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,280
up with the exact same ABI, especially across the network, if you're talking to like some

95
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:49,280
super small embedded device. You want your ABI, especially in C, to be consistent. So,

96
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:56,760
enhanced enumerations will help a lot with that. Another thing that I think my friend,

97
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:03,140
a good friend of mine, he really, really wants from C++, which is the auto keyword. Now,

98
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:10,140
you may know that C++ hijacked the auto keyword. Auto comes from B, which comes before C. Dennis

99
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:17,140
Ritchie worked on, when he worked with B, he wanted, you know, C is supposed to be somewhat

100
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,420
backwards compatible. I don't know a whole lot about B, but the auto keyword came from

101
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:28,300
that. And it was for, I think, locally scoped variables or maybe something like that. And

102
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,660
it just got deprecated and unused over time. So, the auto keyword, you'll notice, is a

103
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:39,660
keyword in C. And now they're deciding, you know, bring auto in and detect types. Of course,

104
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:45,180
you really need that in C++ because some of those types with the namespaces and everything

105
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:52,180
else, the namespaces plus the long class names plus the, you know, the templating make, just,

106
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:59,180
just declaring the type of a variable alone takes up the full 80 columns. For people like

107
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:09,340
me who like to code in 80 columns, you know, you're going to wind up with like 120 minimum

108
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:15,580
just to define your variable, not even assign it. So, auto is super necessary, in my opinion,

109
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:21,980
for C++. Not as necessary in C, but is nice for when you just, you just want to auto it

110
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:26,660
in and you don't want to have to worry about it. I don't, I don't change type names that

111
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:32,380
often. If I do, I use a refactoring tool. So, not crazy. I'm not like banging down the

112
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:39,140
door to get auto in. Another one is const expression. Now, I know you C++ guys, you

113
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:43,680
know what const expressions are. They're a great tool for the compiler. We are not talking

114
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,140
about the same const expression. This is like a lightweight version of const expression,

115
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,760
which does allow some compile time stuff. It's been months since I read the spec on

116
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:59,100
const expression for C, so I don't recall it all off the top of my head, but go check

117
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:05,900
it out. It's kind of like a nice little addition. Again, C is supposed to be lightweight, and

118
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:10,340
I can take or leave any of these. I can code in C99, but I do like to stay up to date in

119
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:16,820
C and mess around with like the generic macro or, you know, some of the modern atomic stuff

120
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:24,700
and things like that. It is nice to stay kind of up to date with computers and just what

121
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:31,540
CPUs and all the CPUs and GPUs are doing these days. So, it's good to stay up to date. That's

122
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:38,420
what's happening in C land. Now, I'm going to take a second to talk about PHP for you

123
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:44,400
web people who still use PHP. I don't, I love PHP because it's so simple. I use Node.js

124
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,220
for websites too. I use things like Firebase for a random website every now and then to

125
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:57,020
throw it up. You know, I, but I do love PHP because it's very flat, straightforward, simple,

126
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:02,340
and it's well supported on basically everything. Like, coding on Windows is pretty easy, debugging

127
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:07,180
in all Windows and all that, at least since I've been doing it for a while. Maybe I'm

128
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:13,620
cheating because I've used it for many years. But PHP 8 came out a while ago, and now I

129
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:21,020
have a little bit of a rant for people who are using PHP and not using PHP 8. I love PHP,

130
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:26,300
and I love the flexibility of it, so I get it. You want to use kind of the old tried

131
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:36,300
and true, but please try out PHP 8, and especially try out the, what are they called, type names.

132
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:44,900
Being able to type name and kind of strongly type your PHP is very nice. And it's great

133
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:50,460
because it's not all or nothing. You can use some strong types, or you should use strong

134
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:57,100
types in many places where you know what the type is going to be. And then you can just

135
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,220
not use strong types in places that you want to deal with, you know, strings or network

136
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:07,420
requests or things coming from the client or going to the client or just arbitrary data,

137
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:15,340
like collections or an array of, you know, if you want to make an array with mixed data

138
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:24,420
types inside of them, that's completely fine. But try out PHP 8 and do use the type name

139
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:33,500
syntax. The reason I bring this up is because I don't see, I continue to see PHP being used

140
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:39,900
in the modern era, and all of them are like, I've even seen stuff on PHP 5, which I used

141
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:49,300
like a decade ago. So PHP 7 is pretty popular, but try out PHP 8, get up to date, it's faster.

142
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:54,820
Type safety, whenever you add type names, you automatically get some magical speed up

143
00:14:54,820 --> 00:15:00,860
in your code just because it's known. Anytime you have something known, your code's going

144
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:09,940
to go faster. This is why native code, like C and C++, are so fast, other than them not

145
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:16,820
having garbage collectors or being interpreted. Everything, you try to make everything known,

146
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:21,580
like you duplicate functions, that's what templates do, they just duplicate the functions

147
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,380
for different types, and everything is just statically known. And so it can be really

148
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:30,100
fast because it knows what it's doing, it knows the size of variables that are going

149
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:38,020
inside of functions, it doesn't have to dynamically allocate the stack. So just a little aside.

150
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,900
In assembly, whenever you compile C or C++, there's a thing called a shadow stack, and

151
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:47,860
there's also home space. This is a space when you call a function, it has to allocate, it

152
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:53,060
uses some registers for the first few arguments, but then it has to allocate the stack, some

153
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:57,940
memory on the stack to be able to know the size of the arguments going in. If the size

154
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:02,340
is arbitrary and jumping around all the time, it's going to have to determine the size before

155
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:09,540
it can allocate that stack space, or it's going to over-allocate the stack space just

156
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:19,780
to support some unknown type. So, yeah, type safety is also good. Just FYI, for all of

157
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:28,660
you PHP programmers out there, give it a try, I promise you'll love it. I love it. I still

158
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:34,780
keep the flexibility and simplicity of PHP, I can write a whole routing, I can write an

159
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:42,660
entire router for a request that comes in, I can take the URL and figure out which, like,

160
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:51,460
get or post request or even to return some content with. In less than 30 lines of code,

161
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:58,420
I can write a PHP router. And that's using all the PHP stuff. So give it a try.

162
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:05,780
The next thing that I want to talk about is programmers' mental health. I saw a lot of

163
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:12,820
news articles recently about programmers with mental health, not issues, but like they're

164
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:17,380
burnt out or, you know, they stopped coding for a while and they're coming back or they

165
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:24,060
just, you know, they can't seem to keep a job or get a job, the job market's hard right

166
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:30,180
now. I'm not looking for a job, so I don't know about it. I know there's been tons and

167
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:36,380
tons of layoffs recently. I don't know how many of those are programmers, but I'm certain

168
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,180
there's got to be quite a few programmers within there. And probably a lot of web programmers,

169
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:48,860
and just because I think they got overstaffed during, you know, the stuff that went on in

170
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:56,620
2020, 2019, all that stuff. So they kind of overstaffed and, you know, now it's hard to

171
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:03,420
find work apparently for some people. Yeah, if you're getting burnt out from programming,

172
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:10,420
I don't know what to tell you, take a break, I don't know. Maybe you're not coding what

173
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:21,520
you love coding. I have coded almost nonstop, no breaks, for nearly 15 years. Hours and

174
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:28,380
hours a day, every day. I still have a wife, I still have kids, I still have a job, I still

175
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:34,220
do random stuff on the side like this thing, and, you know, I still code. I love code.

176
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,060
I sit here and read articles about code. So if you're getting burned out, maybe you're

177
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:46,180
not focusing on what matters most to you. Maybe you're chasing after trends. Maybe you're,

178
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:51,860
you know, not, you're trying too hard to complete projects that you're not interested anymore.

179
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:59,620
I think the key to my success in continuing to code and not get burned out is that I just,

180
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:05,020
whenever I finish coding a part of some big grand idea that I've had, I just quit programming

181
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:10,420
and I'm done and I move on to something else. It's not that important to finish the project.

182
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,340
And you know what, you don't always have to be the guy. You don't have to go make a million

183
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:18,900
dollars, you don't have to be super, you know, you don't have to make some super cool project

184
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,140
that everyone uses or anything like that. You don't have to be the guy. Give yourself

185
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:28,500
some slack, have fun. Coding is fun. Most of it is creative and playing around with

186
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,180
different ideas. It's all just a game. It's a puzzle that you play around with and have

187
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:39,420
fun with. And that's the key. And that's also why I've programmed in so many languages,

188
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:44,660
I've dealt with so many different technologies and also programmed stuff for like Game Boy

189
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:50,740
and I've tried out and learned four different assembly languages. I just have fun. It's

190
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:55,600
just a puzzle to me. So don't burn yourself out. If you're getting burned out, it's probably

191
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:06,420
because you're doing something you don't want to do. This guy here, I'm not going to show

192
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:11,620
it, I don't want to point out anybody specific, but he's saying that he's having a hard time

193
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:19,740
with the job market. But he seems really like blase, super chill and like, you know, get

194
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:27,780
coffee and chill, sip on some tea. It looks like he mentioned, the only reason I know

195
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:32,140
he's a coder is because he mentioned it. There's like a one sentence where it was mentioned

196
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:39,580
in this whole thing. So maybe if you talk more about code and update your LinkedIn,

197
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:43,820
do some things like that. I'm not too fond of his advice. His advice is just like, if

198
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:50,260
you're doing front end, do back end. If you're like, I don't know, stuff about self care

199
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:54,500
and stuff like that. Look, if you want a job in code and programming, I'll tell you the

200
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:00,560
secret. Program a lot. Impress people. Do some math for fun. Make a whole bunch of websites.

201
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:06,220
Make some games. Update your LinkedIn. Recruiters are always looking on LinkedIn. Put a whole

202
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,540
bunch of keywords of everything you've done. So you'll see in the first episode of the

203
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:15,860
podcast where I read off a bunch of stuff that I have messed with, that list and more

204
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:21,540
is on my LinkedIn. And I'm, you know, recruiters. They look up these keywords and that's how

205
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:25,740
they find people. So update your LinkedIn, put in all the keywords of the stuff that

206
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:30,620
you know how to do because you will be tested on them. If you go for a job interview, don't

207
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:37,620
waste anybody's time not knowing how to do something. That being said, my first job,

208
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:42,700
when I barely started coding in PHP, I BSed it and said I knew exactly what I was doing.

209
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,820
And the guy, the owner had me come out to the back and he's like, look, here's my problem

210
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:52,180
with the code. And he left me with it. And I had to figure it out in 30 minutes. And

211
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,460
it was just a, it was a serious problem I had with their company. And this was a small

212
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,420
company and I figured it out in 30 minutes and I blew my own mind. And he was, he hired

213
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:06,060
me on the spot because he was so excited that I solved it. So sometimes that scenario can

214
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:12,180
work, but don't rely on it. Don't take my advice on that.

215
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:20,380
There's been also one other thing related to health and programming is people have been

216
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:26,180
talking about software development ethics. Now I have a very specific view on ethics

217
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:32,620
in programming. If it's a game and it doesn't hurt anybody and you don't steal anybody's

218
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:38,340
stuff and you don't take their money and all this sort of stuff. You know, if you, if you're,

219
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:45,660
if you buy a product and you own it, for example, like if you buy a game, a modern game even,

220
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:50,100
and you tear it apart to figure out what's going on inside of it and you learn their

221
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:56,380
company secrets that way, that's fine. In my opinion, that's you exploring and researching.

222
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:02,600
That's not the ethics I'm talking about here. I think their ethics is more about their focus

223
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:10,780
is kind of on artificial intelligence and it talks about, you know, using AI to steal

224
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:16,220
stuff or scam people and all that sort of stuff. I don't think, I don't think we're

225
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:24,420
going to change anybody's mind on programming ethics. You're just going to code the way

226
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:31,060
that you code. If you're going to get more ethical in programming, you need to be more

227
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:38,620
ethical as a person. I don't mean to make this less technical of a talk, but the problem

228
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:47,060
is at the source. You know, that's the same truth in code as it is with people. So if

229
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:52,940
you find that you're talking to somebody or know somebody that has, you know, they're

230
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:57,820
doing nasty things and stealing people's info and trying to scam them, you're not going

231
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:02,380
to, you're not going to change their mind by writing a blog post about programming ethics

232
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:07,260
and trying to get out there and teach programming ethics to groups of people. I've seen it on

233
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:12,700
LinkedIn. I've seen it in blog posts. I've seen it kind of, it's like, I don't know if

234
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:17,540
people are just trying to become speakers at some kind of event or something, but ethics

235
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:23,100
are at the source and the people have to change their own internal ethics. They have to be

236
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,820
willing not to steal from people. They have to be willing not to lie. They have to be

237
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:33,060
willing to have integrity and not run up the clock for their employer doing nothing. A

238
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:39,380
lot of programmers don't do as much as they should when they're at work or when they're

239
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:46,900
on teams. I have a little story about when I was in college. There was this, I would

240
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:52,580
always be on teams in college and I was the one, even though I went to school for animation,

241
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:57,460
I was the one who was doing the code stuff and I wound up doing all the code. And the

242
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:05,060
coders just didn't, they didn't do their work. Of course, I was a coder at the same time

243
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:12,180
because I was more focused on code at that point. But I wound up doing all the work and

244
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:16,860
they didn't do anything. And that's not their own software development ethics, that's their

245
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:21,700
own personal ethics. They were more interested, one of them was more interested in looking

246
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:29,540
at OpenGL and making a cube move or something. That's just people ethics. You can't preach

247
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:34,940
software ethics to people. If you want to preach ethics, you've got to preach people

248
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:41,980
ethics. Treat people nicely. Don't steal. Don't steal from your employer. Don't steal

249
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:46,620
their time. Don't steal their money. Don't steal from others. Respect others. All these

250
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:57,220
things, this isn't a podcast about morals, but you need to preach morals to people, not

251
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:03,940
software ethic. So please don't go to any of these software ethics talks. I don't know

252
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:13,380
what they really have to talk about. So yeah, that's kind of the mental health aspect of

253
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:23,740
today's thing. And yeah, I just noticed there was a burst in all these, I mean, it seems

254
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:32,020
to be constant ever since 2019. Lots of mental health and kind of existential crises with

255
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:38,340
programmers. I don't know why programmers have this. You know, I feel like I've been

256
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:45,500
playing a game for 15 years. So I haven't really felt this, but all I can say is what

257
00:26:45,500 --> 00:27:10,500
I've done, and hopefully that helps somebody out there.



258
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:23,860
So I want to talk about now Google. Google is one of those, they're not part of ICANN,

259
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:30,860
I don't think. ICANN, the domain name, I don't know what to call them, the domain name consortium

260
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:36,040
or something like that. But they are kind of, they are associated to it, which means

261
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:41,540
they can come up with domain names. And one of the things that they decided to come up

262
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:49,140
with, here I've even got the site here to show you. One of the things that they came

263
00:27:49,140 --> 00:28:00,900
up with is, here's the new domain names. Let me zoom in on this. Okay,.foo. Okay, I feel

264
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:07,020
like that's some kind of programming joke maybe. Okay, that's fine. Let's see, what

265
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:20,760
else? We've got.zip. Now, the eagle-eyed viewer out there will know that.zip is probably

266
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:27,960
not a good idea for a domain extension. What are they called? Top level domain name or

267
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,700
something like that, TLDN or something..zip is probably not a good idea. You probably

268
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,620
shouldn't use super well-known extensions for your domain names. And now, this is the

269
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:44,000
goofy part. Zip, this is their definition. This is what they told ICANN. And these are

270
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,940
approved, I believe. Please note that the launch schedule for this is, this TLD has

271
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:54,920
been modified since being announced. The schedule is published below and has been updated and

272
00:28:54,920 --> 00:29:04,360
approved by ICANN. Zip is a secure domain name for typing, for tying things together

273
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:11,500
or moving really fast. Hosting content on a.zip domain means speed. This is kind of

274
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:21,460
like zip and zippies, zip, zip, zip, zip. So, maybe they didn't realize that's also

275
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:27,060
for the compressed file type. I feel like that's just problems waiting to happen. Like

276
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:34,200
who, first of all, I would never make a domain name unless it's a joke as a.zip because

277
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,400
you'll probably be put on all the spam lists and no one will probably click your link.

278
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,460
They'll think that you're scamming them with a zip file. That's already one problem. And

279
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:51,140
good on them too because I can tell you that.zip domains will probably be used to scam

280
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:59,100
people a lot. You know, freemusic.zip and it'll download a zip file when you go to

281
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:05,580
it. And then of course the kids or whoever is downloading this will then get a virus

282
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:13,700
because they went to this.zip domain. And I know it's not any different than freemusic.com

283
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:22,580
slash zip or slash whatever or freemusic.com and they get a zip file sent to you. But if

284
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:28,740
something downloads when you go to a website, you are probably questioning it. Even a kid

285
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:32,880
would be like, I didn't click on anything. But if you go to a.zip domain and it downloads

286
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,480
something that's a zip file, you probably won't question it as much. I'm just saying.

287
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:46,180
The other one is.mov. Let's see, this is a secure domain for moving pictures and other

288
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:52,780
things that move. For anything that moves you,.move is the perfect domain. This is

289
00:30:52,780 --> 00:31:03,300
also a famous file extension. And if you download a.mov file by going to, I don't know, pocahontas.mov

290
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:09,620
and it downloads a movie called Pocahontas and it's not really a movie file, it's something

291
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:19,100
else, then you have another problem. I love.dad though..dad is a secure domain for

292
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:27,340
dads. And I'm a dad. I can get behind.dad. That's awesome. So I can't get behind.zip.mov,

293
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:38,680
but I can get behind.dad..phd,.professor. Hopefully these show off your teaching credentials.

294
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:44,740
Hopefully these are locked. I don't know if any of these are locked. Like.edu and.gov

295
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:49,820
are locked. You can't get them as an individual. You have to prove that you're an educational

296
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:55,820
institution for.edu and you have to prove you're a government entity for.gov. And that's

297
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:02,180
why those are successful and you can use a.edu for getting discounts and stuff is because

298
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:06,860
they can trust that those are locked. I don't know if PhD and professor are locked, nor

299
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:18,300
do I care. I don't think certain people in society should just get special, like individuals

300
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:24,460
get special privileges for domain extensions. That seems a little weird. Especially when

301
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:33,580
there's a lot of people with PhDs that study weird things and they have a PhD or they study

302
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:37,060
one thing and then they start preaching about another and say they're a doctor. We have

303
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:45,180
a lot of those on the internet. My wife shows me a bunch of them. Just these people masquerading

304
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:51,100
as actual scientists or whatever and they're not. So these are a little weird. I can see

305
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:58,060
these scamming people. I can see these scamming people with kind of just falsified stuff.

306
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:04,420
And even so, there are a lot of doctors and PhD people out there that kind of, they don't

307
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:08,340
have time to do the research. Let's say they're a doctor and they're a surgeon. They don't

308
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:17,020
have time to research some other field of medical science. So they rely on others. And

309
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:23,900
so if someone sent them, if they trust someone and that person's email got hacked and they

310
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,940
sent them a fake thing and then this other person started propagating it, we shouldn't

311
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:37,540
have like authority domains outside of.gov. So I don't know what ESQ is. I think we show

312
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:48,660
you are a bar admissions, Lamar work experience lawyer. Okay. Yeah. So I'm not super down

313
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:53,100
on lockdown domains outside of edu and gov. I think those were two good choices and the

314
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:58,740
only two that I think should exist. Dot dad. That's the one that wins it. I bet you I can

315
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:02,700
saw this list and all they saw was dot dad and it's like, yeah, whatever. I just let

316
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:10,460
it go. We're getting dot dad there. Oh, Nexus. I skipped that one. It's like a hub. Interesting.

317
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,740
Yeah. Zip and MOV are the ones I wanted to complain about and I have complained about

318
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:31,620
them. So let's move on. So another topic that I've seen fairly recently is, I mean, it's,

319
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:38,260
I've seen it recently, but I've seen it essentially the whole time I've done web development and

320
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:43,420
that's people trying to figure out what database to use. Now, a lot of these sites are going

321
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:49,300
to be one versus the other. So like graph database versus a relational database or a

322
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:55,160
no SQL database versus a SQL database. I don't often see vertical databases in here or anything

323
00:34:55,160 --> 00:35:03,700
like that. So our memory cache databases, although my SQL has memory cache, it has,

324
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:11,980
you can set it up to have memory cache as a storage mechanism. So anyways, the debate

325
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:19,380
on which database to use, really you should be using many different databases for the

326
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:26,020
different parts of your program that does different things with data. So you'll use,

327
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:31,300
I think it's a, you'll use like a Redis for a leaderboard so that you can quickly sort

328
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:38,700
and select things. You'll use a MySQL for long term concrete storage. You don't want

329
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:46,140
messed up like accounts and no keeping track of very sensitive data like that. You'll use

330
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:56,700
no SQL databases for game data and quick storage of save data or like where enemies kind of,

331
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:00,220
I don't know if you have like timetables or something and you can put those in there.

332
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:06,660
Just kind of transient data that's not so important that's okay to refill. And you'll

333
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:14,380
use, you know, cache databases for very quick lookups. If especially this is you, you normally

334
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:22,220
front cache like a MySQL relational database. You front cache it so that you can, if something's

335
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:30,220
requested a lot from those structured databases, you can get to that information very quickly.

336
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:36,180
Another one is, what did I mention, the graph database. So a graph database is great for

337
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:42,260
data that is highly intertwined. Think friend graphs, I think we've all seen that. So you

338
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:48,940
have a lot of, you know, data that's connected to, that's interconnected and it can have

339
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:56,100
some blobs of information, you know, like account name and login date and, you know,

340
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:00,780
friends and the friends is the graph or something like that. So use a graph for that kind of

341
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:07,900
data. So what I'm getting at is stop arguing over database types. Use them all. They all

342
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:12,460
have a specific purpose for specific things. There's not one that's going to be a magic

343
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:17,780
bullet and there's not one that's going to solve all your problems. I know that if you

344
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:24,500
use things like Firebase or whatever, they may only support a couple variants of databases,

345
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:31,400
which is bad, but it does help with those types of like live apps or whatever. You should

346
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:38,180
use the database that you need for the time you need it. Cool. You know, key value stores

347
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:44,300
also. I know that NoSQL is often a key value store, but you can also just have a flat like

348
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:50,620
key and value, whether it's a blob of binary data or whatever. So just pick the database

349
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:57,580
that works for the task, not the program, not the whole app, for the task and you'll

350
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:02,020
be happy. That's one of the downsides of web development. If you're a web developer, you've

351
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:07,140
got to use different technologies all the time from the language to the stack to the

352
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:15,860
operating system to the web browser size, whether it's a phone or a desktop window or

353
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:20,700
if it's a database, it doesn't matter. You're using different tech all the time. It's the

354
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:29,180
curse of the job. So that's my view on all the arguments I constantly see over the years

355
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:35,440
of database selection. So don't fall into which database is better. Use the database

356
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:41,140
that works for the specific type of data. It is not unreasonable to use all the databases

357
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:51,100
because you need all those different types of data. And now I can't go on to the fun

358
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:56,740
stuff without talking about artificial intelligence. It's all in the news, so of course there's

359
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:03,540
a lot of news for it. Google has, you know, they had Google I.O. just recently. That's

360
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:16,300
the developer conference for Google. However, it's also part them trying to please the investors

361
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:23,360
and also consumers because a lot of people who are watching Google I.O. have never programmed

362
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:27,600
in their life because they wanted to see the pixel fold. I'm not here to talk about the

363
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:35,040
pixel fold. I'm here to talk about the goofiness of responsible AI. All these people are praising

364
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,220
this responsible AI, and I think that it's, you know, it's good to have responsible AI.

365
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:44,900
However, putting some metadata on a photo and embedding some data into a photo is not

366
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:55,220
responsible AI. Responsible AI comes from the source, not the output. So I know that

367
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:59,260
this is kind of one of the hot arguments on art and that sort of stuff. I'm not here to

368
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:04,660
talk about artificial intelligence, reading people's art and stealing it or anything like

369
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:12,140
that. I have no strong opinions on that. I love AI, and I also love art, and I want to

370
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:22,940
see both of them flourish. So one of the things that felt goofy to me was the responsible

371
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:28,660
AI stuff. And if you know the, if you're in the United States, you may know that all the

372
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:33,620
tech leaders except Elon Musk went to the White House to talk about artificial intelligence

373
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:38,340
and responsible artificial intelligence. So you had like Satya Nadella from Microsoft,

374
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:44,780
you had whoever was from Google. I think the CEOs left and came back. I can't remember

375
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:49,060
the names very well. And then of course all the other places, probably OpenAI and all

376
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:57,820
that. It was a room full of, you know, tech people and the president. So they had this

377
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:04,420
whole meetup about responsible AI. And what does responsible AI mean? Now, it's always

378
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:10,420
kind of goofy to have corporations and CEOs who are beholden to their shareholders in

379
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:19,260
those kinds of meetings to talk about their responsibilities to the human race at large.

380
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:24,340
But you know, it is a good thing that they talk about it. And of course, they get warnings

381
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:35,100
and say, hey, we're going to regulate this thing, probably. So stay in line. Anyways,

382
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:41,500
the one thing that irked me about the AI thing, Google I O was their big push on detecting

383
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:47,540
AI generated images. The image thing really got me because first of all, metadata, they're

384
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:52,020
going to put metadata inside of images. That's fantastic because you know what, whenever

385
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:59,260
you upload an image to any website worth their weight in salt, salt, sugar, worth their weight

386
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:08,540
in gold, they strip meta tags. So meta is useless. It just gets discarded by all companies

387
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:12,940
because well, first they read it, they read it for themselves. They want to get your GPS

388
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:19,340
location, all that stuff that's in your photo. By the way, turn off GPS on your photos. Nobody

389
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:29,900
uses the photos, where was I GPS thing on your phone. You're just giving people your

390
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:35,260
position all the time. It's kind of strange. And who knows who can get access to that.

391
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:39,580
But anyways, before they take that photo and send it off and propagate it to everybody,

392
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:44,040
they completely strip meta tags just so that it does protect your personal information

393
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:48,900
because photos, the meta for photos can have a lot of stuff in there that shouldn't. And

394
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:54,300
also if you're a web developer, strip the meta. Do not just take people's photos and

395
00:42:54,300 --> 00:43:01,020
host them. Strip the meta. There's tons, you can just take a photo. If you're doing Node.js

396
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:05,020
for example, there's a library where you just take the photo and when it takes the photo

397
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:11,660
you can have it as part of one of the arguments to just strip the meta. And if you don't know

398
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:16,460
how to do meta stripping or anything like that, the easiest way to do it if you're kind

399
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:23,460
of new to coding or you're not well versed on how to access the metadata on a file, if

400
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:28,340
you take the photo and then use like magics or whatever it's called, just any kind of

401
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:33,980
image library and just crop it by like a, you don't even, I don't even think you have

402
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:39,020
to change it at all, but you probably should just so that you know that it's working. Just

403
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:46,580
like crop it or change something about it using the photo editing software or photo

404
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:51,860
editing library and then save it. And that just strips the meta automatically because

405
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:55,900
it's saving a new image. So strip the meta inside of the photos and videos please. Do

406
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:03,140
not, do not, do not read it, do not take it, do not sell it, do not redistribute it. Strip

407
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:11,340
the meta. So the second thing is, and this is probably the more clever one, but not exactly

408
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:16,660
perfect. That's where you can encode data inside of an image without changing how the

409
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:23,700
image looks. So you can inject data that's not metadata, you know, like, you know, into

410
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:29,660
the interlaced into the pixels or interlaced into the header or anything like that of the

411
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:38,140
file. Now that's obviously not something that gets stripped very easily, but if you open

412
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:42,900
that photo inside of a photo editor and save it, that's just going to be gone. It's not

413
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:46,820
encoded in the pixels. I mean, even if it is encoded in the pixels, it's just going

414
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:51,580
to resave the pixels in a new way when you export from a photo program. So it's like

415
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:55,740
the easiest thing to get rid of. So even if you use that library example where you just

416
00:44:55,740 --> 00:45:00,580
take it and crop it or whatever and then save it again, that little encoded data that was

417
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:05,620
in there is now gone because it got resaved maybe as a different format or a format that

418
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:12,220
doesn't support interlaced data inside of the pixels. So that's my rant on that. That

419
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:18,260
was just lip service. The photos stuff, just pure lip service by Google on trying to make

420
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:22,740
people think that they're thinking about ethical AI. In fact, in my opinion, that's a complete

421
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:29,180
waste of money. You shouldn't be putting, you know, in fact, that doesn't even cost

422
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:33,820
them that much money to put that in, you know, on the output of the image. Instead of investing

423
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:39,780
money in ethical AI output and the file that gets outputted, you need to invest ethical

424
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:45,980
AI in the input, how you train the system, what you do with the system. That's ethical.

425
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:54,460
It's two different arguments. So don't believe the hype on when people talk about encoding

426
00:45:54,460 --> 00:46:02,620
will tell you if it's a AI inside of the image or AI generated in the image. It's nonsense.

427
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:07,260
Invest in a service where I can upload a picture to Google and it has a memory of all the photos

428
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:12,900
it generated so it can tell me if that photo was generated by AI. That right there doesn't

429
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:18,740
need metadata. It doesn't need to put little tags inside of the binary. That just me send

430
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:24,740
you it and you tell me whether it is. Just do that. That's probably way more useful.

431
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:30,940
And then just make that an API I can call. So I guess that was kind of a rant on ethical

432
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:38,620
AI. I'm going to talk about some fun stuff now. I've seen in like programming humor stuff,

433
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:45,020
a lot of people are fighting over text editors. This is funny to me because we have people

434
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:51,860
saying I use notepad. Of course we all use notepad to do some code. But they're all ragging

435
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:56,540
on Visual Studio Code. I don't know why. Probably because Visual Studio Code came out and it

436
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:01,020
became really popular because it's Node.js, you can host it in the web, it has all kinds

437
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:07,260
of easy plugins, you can use web technology to write your plugins. And I've written like

438
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:14,820
language servers and stuff like that for Visual Studio Code. It's nice. But you have all kinds

439
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:23,220
of people talking about notepad or atom or my text editor runs inside of a terminal.

440
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:29,180
Visual Studio Code doesn't. My text editor runs a web page within it and all this other

441
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:36,900
stuff. So that's a lot of fun. Go into programming humor and please post some more text editor

442
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:44,380
jokes because I love them. They're funny to me. I think nobody's taking it seriously.

443
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:49,580
Of course there are people out there that are diards on their text editors. I can use

444
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:53,340
anything. I can use notepad, I use C-Line, I use Visual Studio, I use Visual Studio Code,

445
00:47:53,340 --> 00:48:03,300
I use Nano, I sometimes use Vim, I use web div, editable divs. It doesn't matter to me.

446
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:09,500
Text is text. It's whatever. As long as I can press tab and I get a tab, that's all

447
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:19,260
I need. But those are kind of funny. So here's a, I have an example here of one. This is

448
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:23,780
just one. I saw like seven of these. I think there's a thing going on right now where everyone's

449
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:32,940
doing them. But go contribute to these. And now I'm going to talk about, I don't know

450
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:39,500
anything about this indie game or anything else. I just know it looked kind of fun. So

451
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:43,220
I thought I'd share it just because I kind of want to talk about indie games every now

452
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:48,140
and then that piqued my interest. It may be a copy of another indie game. It may be a

453
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:55,580
clone. It may be a stolen idea or whatever. The concept is pretty fun. I'm actually going

454
00:48:55,580 --> 00:49:00,020
to turn it off. It has some music. I don't know if it's copyright. But the idea is that

455
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:05,020
you have these little paddles on the bottom and you got to slap the boxes that are coming

456
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:12,340
down. And as you rotate them, the paddles on the bottom sticks in place. So you have

457
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:16,180
the blue one on the right now. It can wind up all the way on the left. And I thought

458
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:21,620
that was kind of a neat little puzzle game. I love puzzle games. I love first person shooters,

459
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:26,260
puzzle games, RTS. I love all kinds of games. So I thought this one was kind of fun. So

460
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:34,780
I kind of wanted to shout out. Whatever game this is. It's called Swap I guess. Pretty

461
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:41,900
neat idea. It's fun. It's simple. Hopefully it's not just going to be a mobile game. Hopefully

462
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:45,980
there's going to be more to it. I'm not super into mobile games. But it does have iOS and

463
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:52,580
Android here. And it's coming on Steam. So I don't know. If you're a developer, add some

464
00:49:52,580 --> 00:50:02,580
cool desktop perks. Don't make your game lock down. Don't lock down its potential to mobile

465
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:10,100
devices. And that's kind of another thing I guess I'll end on. If you're going to make

466
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:17,780
a game and you're going to put it on different devices, one of the things that I don't like,

467
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:24,260
for example, is old games like Grand Theft Auto, Vice City or something coming to mobile

468
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:30,220
because the controls are clunky. And I didn't buy it because I didn't want to play it on

469
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:38,100
phone. I have copies of Vice City on Xbox and PlayStation 2 I think it is over there

470
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:46,180
somewhere. So I didn't spend any money on it. But I doubt it has good Bluetooth controller

471
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:53,060
support. A lot of games on mobile don't. So if you put your game on Steam or whatever,

472
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:58,060
make some controller support on mobile. Put in the extra effort. I know it kind of sucks.

473
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:03,860
But let's make mobile games better by adding more support controls. Let's add a whole realm.

474
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:09,820
Let's force Google and Apple to have a little tag on there that says, you know, controller

475
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:13,060
required or something like that. Let's just make a whole category for it. That would be

476
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:18,500
fantastic. I would love that. But anyways, yeah, that was a cool little indie game called

477
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:24,940
Swap. Don't know much more than that video. That's all I've seen. So that's about it.

478
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:44,940
Thanks for listening and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye for now.
