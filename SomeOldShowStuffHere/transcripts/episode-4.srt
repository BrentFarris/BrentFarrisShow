00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
All right, welcome back. Today I learned that Valve is getting sued for the Steam Deck.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:13,880
Other than that, I wanted to talk about private chats, some AI stuff, some local AI stuff,

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:21,800
clean code and GitHub and that sort of stuff. So I guess the very first thing straight off,

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:29,000
I just learned about it a minute ago, was that Valve is now getting sued or, I don't

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,040
know, a lawsuit has been filed for the Steam Deck and you may be wondering what on earth

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:46,680
could it be over? And that's exactly what I was thinking. And it's for a patent. No,

7
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,880
Steam didn't, or Valve didn't just blatantly copy a patent or steal it or anything like

8
00:00:52,880 --> 00:01:00,120
that. It's just that Valve is falling prey to a patent troll. If you don't know what

9
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:07,680
a patent troll is, it's basically a consortium of people who buy up software and hardware

10
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,440
patents and they produce nothing themselves. They just sit around on their thumbs doing

11
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:19,040
nothing other than they had some money to buy some ideas from people that were probably

12
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,440
smarter than they are. Or maybe they're not as smart as they are because they're the ones

13
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,560
who bought all the patents. And essentially what they do is they sue everybody and force

14
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:40,840
them to pay them royalties. And the patent that I didn't even know was a patent is haptics.

15
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:48,360
So the little vibrations that you feel on basically everything from phones to controllers,

16
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:54,520
those apparently are patented by some dudes somewhere who had enough money to buy the

17
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:00,560
patent and then do nothing other than sit there and reap rewards of everyone else's

18
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:08,200
success. I'm a little annoyed at it. I've always disliked patent trolls. I think the

19
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:15,600
way that I put it on Twitter was the idea guys that do nothing and sit in mom's basement

20
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:22,360
and perhaps all the other guys went off and they made something successful, but this dude

21
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:29,960
had equity so he's just going to reap the rewards for existing. It's very annoying.

22
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:38,160
It sucks. I think it stifles innovation. That's basically my take on that. In fact, here we

23
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:48,240
can take a look at it. Here I have the link. This is from The Verge. You can see, well,

24
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:54,360
it's night for you, morning, or it's night for me, morning for you. This just happened

25
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:02,760
a minute ago. The company is called Immersion Corporation. And that right there, that name

26
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:09,120
kind of gives away the game. Immersion Corporation sounds like we bought up all the patents for

27
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,240
haptics that we could find on the internet and are going to sue everybody into the ground

28
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:19,880
and otherwise force them to pay us royalties and also give us a big chunk of change right

29
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:28,040
at the beginning underneath the table. Otherwise, we're going to sue you. It's really annoying.

30
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:34,280
Immersion Corporation, I even looked up who the heck is Immersion Corporation and it's

31
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:42,440
just a bunch of flashy videos of phones and stuff. They produce nothing as far as I can

32
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:53,360
tell on here. Just some company that I would dare say stole patents with money. Stole it

33
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:00,480
with money. Anyways, that's really annoying. It happens to the best of us. Valve is probably

34
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,640
just going to pay them the money under the table or out of the court to skip the lawsuit

35
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:18,960
and just pay them royalties. I'm a little miffed about that. I don't know if other people

36
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,920
have the same feelings about it. I'm sure a lot of people are ambivalent to it. It just

37
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:35,040
annoys me, the guys who do nothing and prey on others. It's a little... Anyways, well

38
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,360
that's that. One of the things I wanted to go over today other than that, since that

39
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:50,240
popped out of nowhere, was private messages. Twitter recently released their secure messages.

40
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:58,480
I think that they were in talks with the guys from Signal and they produced their untrustable

41
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:08,560
or the don't trust it yet messaging system. That's just something that they mentioned.

42
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:16,880
Don't trust it yet, give it a try though. Now, I'm not a Twitter hater or I don't know

43
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:27,120
whatever bandwagon people have about all that. What I like is that there are private messages

44
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,200
at all, secure messages at all. A company like this does not have to add secure messaging

45
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:42,200
to their app. They could just go on being completely insecure. That's not great for

46
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:48,520
the people. It doesn't actually... Look, nobody is saying, I'm going to make a Twitter account

47
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:55,520
now because the messages are secure. I'm pretty sure most people don't even use Twitter direct

48
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,880
messages. I've never even used it. I'd like to use it now that it's secure. I'd like to

49
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:07,440
see what it looks like. Is there a little padlock or something? I'm curious. Not something

50
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:16,320
I'm going to jump ship from. I use Signal for all of my private messages with my family,

51
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:22,160
both my immediate family, like my wife and I almost exclusively talk on Signal. I have

52
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,560
a family group chat on there where I talk with all of my family. Sure, it does use up

53
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,680
a lot of your storage because it's locally stored. That's the whole point is that it's

54
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:39,160
not stored on somebody's server somewhere. I'm probably not going to be jumping ship

55
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:47,720
off of Signal anytime soon, maybe even ever. It all depends on where they take it. Companies

56
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:54,080
like this can promise the world and then swap out from underneath you to doing something

57
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:01,800
else. I think, though I like Telegram, I don't actively use it because it's hosted on somebody's

58
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:09,560
server somewhere and they kind of just promise security and safety and that sort of stuff.

59
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,440
You can trust it. Lots of people do. They could be telling the truth. I do like the

60
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:20,440
idea of it all being locally on my device, even if it is a little bit of an annoyance,

61
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,440
taking up the space and then having to make backups and then not being able to transfer

62
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:30,040
it to another device like my desktop. There are annoyances for it not being a server.

63
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:35,960
I would host my own or make my own little messaging app for my family. I've done Diffie

64
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,440
Hellman encryption, the whole process of updating the key on every message and all that sort

65
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:46,800
of stuff for fun. Making a whole app that my whole family is willing to jump on and

66
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,720
even friends and new friends are willing to jump on, it's not going to happen. It's a

67
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:57,560
lot easier for me to just use Signal. Moral of the story here is that I love that Twitter

68
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:07,600
is moving towards these secure DMs. Everything should be secure DMs. It's just out of respect

69
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:13,240
for the people who use your platform. All in all, they are trying to advertise to you

70
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,560
and you never know what's going on in the background. I think these are also on the

71
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:25,120
server kind of obviously. Same difference between the Twitter DMs and what's the one

72
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:36,320
Facebook owns, that one, and Telegram and all of those. So stick with Signal because

73
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,680
it's local. Signal does store it on a server until it gets delivered and confirm that it's

74
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:49,920
delivered. So there is that little middleman aspect there. It's kind of like a cousin of

75
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,280
mine. He said he loves Apple because of their secure messages. And then I asked him, I was

76
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:02,880
like, well, you know, they do have secure messages, but if you buy a new phone, you

77
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,280
get all of your old messages out of nowhere. That means that all the messages were stored

78
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:13,480
on some server and they can be decrypted on a different device. Just the different device

79
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,480
that exists, that just so happens to exist with your phone number. I don't know if it's

80
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,720
locked to your phone number or anything. So you can get all of your old messages and they

81
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,640
all get decrypted. So that right there just means that it exists somewhere and it can

82
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:34,240
be decrypted. So security is in the promise, I suppose, on that. But yeah, that was my

83
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:40,960
thoughts on Twitter secure DMs. If anyone exists out there that wants to try it out,

84
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:51,800
send me a message on Twitter. And yeah, thank you. So that's basically it for the secure

85
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:59,880
messaging stuff. I don't want to go on too much of a rant for that. Now, I did want to

86
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:07,240
talk about some AI stuff. As you know, I deal with AI stuff for fun. I like making random

87
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:14,280
prompts, that sort of stuff. Nothing serious. So I am not up to date on all the crazy newness

88
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,280
and all the things people are doing now and the tricks and that sort of stuff. So I just

89
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:27,280
learned about GPT4ALL today, which was pretty neat. If you haven't heard of it, it's basically

90
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:35,280
a local instance of these different models that you can run locally on your computer

91
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:44,400
without internet. And depending on your computer's processing power, it'll be slower or faster.

92
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:51,760
And you don't need a GPU to run it. I think that's because most of the training happens

93
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:58,280
through GPUs. But this is not training it. I think there is a way to train your own stuff,

94
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,760
which would be pretty cool. You'd take all the documents you've ever written or maybe

95
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,560
all the transcripts of all your videos or something like that and train the model on

96
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:14,040
it to be kind of like a mini-you, which would be kind of neat to see. But I like it just

97
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:21,600
for its local instance. So I wanted to point that out. I wanted to show which model I'm

98
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:29,720
using because the website itself says that this is the good model. So let's see if I

99
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:42,720
can zoom in. Oh, I can't zoom in. It's GPT4ALL JV1.3 Groovy. And if you go to GPT4ALL, here

100
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:51,800
let's just grab this and stick it up here, on their website they just boast about its

101
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:57,520
features. If you can't find the model you want, they do have this little drop-down that

102
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,000
tells you about the different models. So the one that's already selected is the one that

103
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,560
I downloaded. For me it was the second from the top, but I'm sure those shift around.

104
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:17,960
And it's the current best commercially licensable model based on GPT-J. And commercially licensable,

105
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:25,420
the reason that there is a distinction on these is that you can actually run a server

106
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:31,960
with this local instance. And you can run Python scripts to query against it and act

107
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:39,200
as like a client. And you can serve up servers and like make money using it and all that

108
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,720
sort of stuff. However, these models are licensed. Somebody did all the effort in training them.

109
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,160
So this particular one you can pay somebody, I guess, to use it if you want to use it commercially.

110
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:59,380
There are other ones like this Snoozy one, current best non-commercial commercially licensable

111
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:06,600
model. And the reason for that is that this is based on Llama13b, which is I think the

112
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:15,400
Facebook leaked stuff. So that's why you can't be like, yo, Facebook, I'm going to use that

113
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:20,360
thing that got leaked from your company. Can I give you a couple bucks? So obviously you

114
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,400
can't do that. But yeah, go give this a try. I was playing around with it on my laptop,

115
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:32,560
which is a Linux laptop with an Intel 11th Gen Tiger Lake, I think. It's not, yeah, Tiger

116
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,040
Lake processor. And it was fast enough. It was pretty decent. It wasn't like incredibly

117
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,120
slow. You'll try some of these offline ones and they're super slow. It was decently fast.

118
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,920
I haven't tried it on this computer yet, this laptop, much more beefy 12th Gen Intel core

119
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:58,000
processor. So I would be surprised if this one wasn't even faster. So yeah, go give this

120
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,920
a shot and try out that model. It's the second from the top for me, like I said, just review

121
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:14,680
it on the website and pick the model that you find most interesting. Another thing that

122
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:22,440
I learned about today, like I said, I'm just passively an AI person, prompter, whatever.

123
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,840
I don't make images or anything. I just like to prompt it and see what kind of stuff it

124
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:33,800
comes up with and cross-reference it or cross-check it. I don't know, check its work and that

125
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:39,200
sort of stuff. I do like to generate very small scripts that I really am too lazy to

126
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:48,320
write. So an example of a script that I wrote that I modified, I asked the AI to write it

127
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,200
for me, was a Lua script that took in a text file and this text file had time marks and

128
00:14:54,200 --> 00:15:00,640
then text of what was being said at those time marks. And it converted it into an SRT

129
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:07,960
file, which is just a closed captioning kind of timing file that prints out the text that's

130
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:14,520
being said at that timestamp. So I just told it to write me that script and it busted one

131
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:19,800
out, had a couple of mistakes in it. It didn't check for blank lines and that sort of stuff

132
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:25,760
that I just quickly knocked it out and fixed it. And also added a little extra feature

133
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,360
so it would spit out an extra text file, which was just the raw text of what was said without

134
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:38,360
timestamps. So I do play around with these for all sorts of things, stories and code

135
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:45,760
and all that. But something I learned about today was super prompts, which is an awesome

136
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:52,480
name. I do love when names are nice, like, I don't know, fun, fun like this. Some names

137
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,880
can be really boring, like they're just named after people. Like some of these models like

138
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,640
Ada or DaVinci or whatever. Cool, you named it after a person. But super prompt, that's

139
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:12,000
awesome. I mean, super is used for a ton of things. Basically, you can probably be sued

140
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:19,280
by Nintendo by putting super in front of stuff. They've used it so much. But I don't know,

141
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:25,440
I like the title of it. So what I learned about the super prompt today is basically

142
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,880
you either set up a really big prompt, it's this huge prompt that uses almost all of your

143
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,880
tokens. And if you don't know what a token is, it's essentially you get 4096 tokens or

144
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:45,240
so depending on the service you use and what you pay for and all that. And each, about

145
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:51,120
a third of each word is a token. So just say like each word is a token. And it really depends.

146
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,840
It could be the characters if you're using UTF-8 or whatever, and you're using foreign

147
00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:00,400
characters it may be per character that's presented. But generally in English I think

148
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:08,360
what they stated is it's on average about 75% of a word. And you can have up to 4096

149
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:15,160
of these tokens. And then when you hit that limit it won't respond or it just doesn't

150
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:21,680
know what to do. Often it'll say too much text or whatever. The webpage or whatever.

151
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:27,800
Even the local ones do this. They'll say, I filed too long or something like that. But

152
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:36,400
you can either pre-prompt it with one gigantic prompt and have it try to say things it shouldn't

153
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,160
say. Some people try to make it say bad words or whatever. But others try to make it sound

154
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:50,360
even more human or like you're talking to some specific character in history and making

155
00:17:50,360 --> 00:18:00,440
it kind of reply as if it was that person. So the super prompt isn't always just the

156
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:07,160
one big prompt in the beginning. It's also you're able to do it by feeding it multiple

157
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:14,200
prompts over and over and kind of building out this super context I'll call it. I don't

158
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:22,320
think it's called super context but I'm going to call it super context. And what people do is they call it hypnosis.

159
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:30,680
They hypnotize the AI so to speak by repeating things they've previously said in varied ways

160
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:37,200
in order to kind of shepherd it into a certain direction. And that's just so that they can

161
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:45,040
hit the neurons that aren't often hit on the fringes of the, I don't know what to call

162
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:52,400
it, AI matrix mind. And then you can get some pretty cool responses. You can see kind of

163
00:18:52,400 --> 00:19:01,240
the depth of its understanding of things. So those are kind of fun. That's what I learned

164
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:07,920
about today, super prompting. So go try to super prompt. Maybe you've done it without

165
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:18,720
even noticing that you've done it. Here I've just for completeness I asked Bing what a

166
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:25,400
super prompt was. And this was his response. You can pause to see this. I guess if you're

167
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:34,000
doing an audio only podcast. It says the super prompt is a term used in the context of chat

168
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,640
GPT. I don't know if it's specific to chat GPT. I just know it's used commonly with chat

169
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,760
GPT and other similar language models. It refers to a prompt that is designed to generate

170
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,920
a more advanced and complex response from the model. Super prompts are used to train

171
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:54,520
the model and generate more sophisticated responses that are closer to human-like conversation.

172
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:00,280
They're usually more detailed and specific rather than prompts that can include multiple

173
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:09,160
parts or sub parts. And these prompts can get long, by the way. So I think somebody

174
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:15,520
recorded like, I don't know if it was 16 minutes or 16 hours for chat GPT to respond with one

175
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:25,200
of these super prompts. And it was pretty neat. So go try super prompts today.

176
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:31,280
So we're going to jump from AI. We're going to talk more about some programming stuff.

177
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,040
As you know, I'm a programmer. I love code. I code all the time. I code as a day job.

178
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,000
I love code so much that I make this podcast and I include code stuff because I just love

179
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,720
code. So.



180
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:52,680
You may have noticed a huge trend in the last few years of people moving to clean code

181
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,680
I want to use quote clean code

182
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,440
or people moving towards

183
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,460
You know

184
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,640
craftsmanship

185
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,000
clean

186
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,120
architecture all the stuff all these buzzwords and

187
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:11,560
Clean code is basically like testable code test driven development for some people

188
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,560
Tiny functions

189
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:19,720
Making every making it so that your code doesn't need comments to explain itself anybody can read it

190
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:27,240
And I like to throw design patterns in there because it's not often said with clean code for some reason as far as I've seen

191
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:33,960
But there's some really good design patterns that help you create clean code. My favorite design pattern is

192
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,760
the visitor pattern and

193
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:43,000
Visitor pattern and that's basically where you can create a system that executes

194
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,440
some unknown

195
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,760
maybe

196
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,000
structured concept it's hard to explain and

197
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:55,320
You pass it a class or you pass it a function and that's the mechanic that it runs

198
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,840
The context that it runs within so in that way you can have this

199
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:07,800
Core system that does a specific thing and you can alter it by passing in a class with certain functions or functions

200
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,640
themselves to change the behavior while keeping that one particular

201
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:21,640
Piece of code. So I think an easy example would be like rather than using inheritance to say there's an animal and from the animal

202
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,360
there is or there's a being which

203
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:30,320
Animal derives from and then you have a dog and a cat and they both have speak and they do a different response

204
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,840
instead of having a hierarchy

205
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,920
you can have a flat class that is

206
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:41,600
Animal processor and then you pass in a dog which has a speak function you pass in a cat which has a speak function

207
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,000
And it does speak that way so you don't have to do inheritance in that way

208
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,160
Cats and dogs in this scenario don't have any relationship at all

209
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:56,040
They don't have to you can use an interface or you can pass them as a function the cat function that does

210
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:04,160
The cat speak function or whatever and so the class itself that's managing it just knows that it gets things that speak and

211
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,960
It runs the speak code on it. So

212
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,340
That's the visitor pattern. There's tons of patterns

213
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:18,200
Just look up the gang the gang of four book if you have the book you can just go to the very back

214
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,240
The very back of the book and it has a list of all the patterns, which is nice

215
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,760
But yes, I will say

216
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,560
All that being said do not

217
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,120
Do not

218
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,680
Vehemently abide by clean code. I'll tell you this now I

219
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:47,760
Write test functions to test AI generated code, but I don't often write test functions for my own code in my own projects

220
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,760
I

221
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,000
Make small functions that do very specific things

222
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:57,360
which it would be nonsensical for me to test because

223
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,680
Especially when I'm working alone when I'm working with a team, it's a different story

224
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,880
But when I'm working alone, I don't need to over complicate it. I know when I write a function

225
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:12,720
I don't change it if I change it. I'm very specific on how I refactor it whether it gets all deleted and

226
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,840
Replaced with something else or something in that realm. So

227
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:24,880
All you clean coders out there. Congratulations for knowing what clean code is and clean architecture and design patterns and

228
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,280
Test driven development and all that sort of stuff

229
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,720
but

230
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,960
Life is life is simple. Take it take it easy. Don't be zealot about it and

231
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,320
One of the things that you'll find is

232
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:46,160
If you adhere too close to clean code and everything's interfaces and everything's abstract and everything's going everywhere

233
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,520
especially for

234
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,520
your own personal projects or

235
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,200
Projects you put up on github as libraries. You'll find that you wind up with

236
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:02,680
Unreadable code anyways, even though your whole goal was to make readable code you get way too many

237
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,000
Intertwined different things or disconnected things even worse

238
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,920
One of the things I just an aside

239
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,640
When I program in unity, I like to

240
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,920
Leverage unity so all of its signals all of its how it connects different objects

241
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:24,960
I like to leverage it because when another person who's using unity comes and they they want to work with me

242
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,960
or they they

243
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,640
Just see the code or see the project. They understand what's going on

244
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,920
They can find where things are and what things are doing

245
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,080
they don't have to go through and

246
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:42,200
Find the class and then go to its manager and then go to the then go to the facade which manages the managers

247
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,880
List which comes from a factory which comes from an abstract factory

248
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,880
They don't need to go through all that to figure out that the character can jump they can see just straight in the code

249
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,880
Exactly what it's doing

250
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,800
And I get trying to abstract a way to make everything interchangeable and all that

251
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,480
But I will argue

252
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,640
That as a huge proponent of clean code by the way

253
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,840
In a lot of scenarios when especially in working with teams

254
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,480
It is a major downside and I will argue that

255
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,080
It'll bloat your code and make it unreadable if you adhere to it too far

256
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,360
And it'll slow down your code because you've you've abstracted everything

257
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,320
Just off to oblivion so

258
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,840
What I like to do in my personal projects is I like to stick to flat

259
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,720
non-hierarchical

260
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,200
refactorable code the most important thing in my mind is

261
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,120
That I write code that is easy to refactor whether it's deleting whole functions and replacing them with another

262
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,720
Or I write code that is easy to refactor

263
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,720
whether it's deleting whole functions and replacing them with another or

264
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,440
just

265
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,440
changing out being able to

266
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:59,920
Delete maybe an entire set of files or change out the data structure

267
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,880
Easily, that's what I aim for is refactorable code because I refactor my code

268
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:12,480
Non-stop all the time over and over my game engine that I was I've written NC has been rewritten multiple times

269
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,680
I've converted it to C++ and converted back to C twice and

270
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,240
I've also

271
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,080
Refactored the entire math library and everything else. And so it's been it's like

272
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,240
What's that joke Theseus's ship?

273
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,520
I know that off the top of my head because

274
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:34,440
My wife has been making fun of this person who fixes her husband's shoes and not making fun of her

275
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,920
But making fun of the people comment on it because every comment is oh, it reminds me of Theseus ship

276
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,320
But that's kind of what my code is. Like everything's been replaced

277
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,920
It's it's not none of the code is the same from the original maybe except for some of my standard string

278
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,920
String functions and stuff like that

279
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:57,000
So that's my thoughts on the clean code try to do clean code, but don't don't stick to it too strictly

280
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,100
Now I I don't want to speak just to advanced programmers

281
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:08,200
to to more inexperienced programmers people who are just

282
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:15,040
Learning or learning the ropes or getting into things or you're an advanced programmer. You've done assembly coding, but you haven't done any web

283
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:20,760
One of the things that I've seen in repositories recently, which is why I want to talk about it is

284
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:29,000
you'll find API keys and other sensitive keys and that sort of stuff inside of public github repositories and

285
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:35,000
You know people can take those keys and wind up racking up a bill for you

286
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,680
in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if there's people who

287
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,760
crawl through the different projects looking for

288
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,960
Keywords for specific API's and see if they can't get a free key for a little bit and

289
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,040
And I've seen people ask about it, what do you do with you know these keys so

290
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,320
Especially in web or any kind of development. It doesn't have to be web. You could be deploying

291
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:03,320
Game server or anything like that. You don't put your keys anywhere in your code base at all

292
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:11,040
I if you need to regenerate keys because you forgot it or you've deleted something that you're keeping it

293
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,360
It is a secure place. You were keeping it in no big deal regenerate it

294
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,680
But

295
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,880
What you want to do is when you deploy?

296
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,000
your

297
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,200
Code your application your game server is that you want to push your key?

298
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,480
Through through and add it as the environment variables

299
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,840
Or add it as a file. That's inaccessible

300
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,440
That's kind of in a weird directory that is hard for anyone to accept access without

301
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,560
You know root privileges or something like that

302
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,160
Just you want to push your keys?

303
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,720
Into your server, so don't put it in your code base. Don't put in any code base

304
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,760
Don't even put it in a private repository. Just keep them locally and

305
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,400
Push them if you're using docker

306
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,040
Often you'll put these in environment variables

307
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,080
And just push them off to the server, so

308
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,240
That's just a little tip on that because I've seen some issues with that

309
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,600
so

310
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,920
This one is pretty cool. I found a random project where

311
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,240
somebody was doing a map of

312
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,560
github and

313
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,600
This was a pretty neat project. I

314
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,600
Like these kinds of things I

315
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,000
Like especially and like in these where it connects things

316
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,120
I don't know why they're connected probably because they're forks of each other or something like that

317
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,040
but I have this page here called map of github and

318
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,480
This is who it's made by and that and Vaca

319
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,560
here I mean

320
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,600
and go to his

321
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,480
And go to his in Seattle

322
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,840
There's a lot of web stuff anyways

323
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,760
here

324
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,120
Here's land of unity so we can zoom in on the land of unity

325
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,160
And you can see a whole bunch of little dots starting to appear as you get closer you get

326
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,800
inundated with a sea of dots and you can

327
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,960
Click on I think the circle yeah, and then you can see all these lines connecting it to things

328
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,560
Why they're connected to those things. I don't know like

329
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:30,680
Let's go to it page not found. Oh, I guess some of these are broken. How about you?

330
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,200
Outline effect. Oh it has a it looks like it's read me here

331
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,500
Yeah, I think it sticks its read me inside of there

332
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:47,700
Why is it connected to something else maybe it's a sub repository or something like that. It's just a read me

333
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,960
Oh a view code. I'm not in desktop mode. It's collapsed. Oh

334
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,720
Maybe it's these packages

335
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,600
It's probably these packages

336
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,960
Anyways, I don't want to get it. I don't go Bronson through this stuff

337
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:11,480
And the podcast but I thought this was really neat if you guys know any projects like these just random stuff

338
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,840
It's like a mind map basically

339
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:19,200
FBX exporter whoo? Unity FBX exporter

340
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,200
Unity technologies, I guess this oh, this must be the unity's FBX

341
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:30,320
Exporter plug-in no unity 3d Japan. Oh, maybe anyways

342
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,680
Like I said, I can browse these all day long. So if you have any that you like

343
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,920
Similar to this or you know any language? I

344
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,120
It doesn't matter to me

345
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,000
I sent him my way. I love to look through these

346
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,760
So I

347
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,960
This is

348
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,200
On a related note

349
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,880
Have you I don't know if you've explored

350
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:05,260
Get the hub before it took me a long and like I've had a github account forever and I never went through the explore tab

351
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,600
Which is hilarious because

352
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,680
That's I mean, I just showed you I like to look around at those kinds of things but a

353
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,400
Few years back. I started using the explore tab

354
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:22,480
And so you can find things like this one that I shared was game engines

355
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,080
And I've done a video in the past like I don't know a while ago

356
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:32,880
A couple maybe a year or two ago about all the different game engines that you can find

357
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:39,520
Inside a github for all different kinds of things 2d 3d half-baked all that sort of stuff

358
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,520
Of course, you're gonna have your number one

359
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,200
most starred stuff up here Godot

360
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,840
But you know you'll have

361
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,000
I'm gooey. I am GUI however you want to say it

362
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,120
the popular UI library, so

363
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,960
It's kind of essentially it doesn't

364
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,000
Keep track of the things it creates. It's it's an immediate mode. That's what I am stands for

365
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,400
It's an immediate mode where you have to tell it to render stuff what it's rendering kind of every frame

366
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,320
But I'm not gonna go through all these but there's there's all kinds like that

367
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:21,440
This is a refreshing a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in rust

368
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,880
so

369
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:28,720
I guess bevy must be a popular one for the rust the rust arians rust atonians

370
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,720
all the rusty's

371
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
It's pretty cool

372
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,320
But there

373
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:43,320
There I was about say hundreds. There are thousands like there's 5,000. Let me scroll down to the bottom here

374
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:50,800
Maybe it's not at the bottom. There's oh here. It is is at the top. There's almost well. There's

375
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,880
If you round up almost 6,000

376
00:34:54,880 --> 00:35:01,200
Almost 6,000 I game engines and you know, some of them are pretty cool

377
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,520
I kind of spent some time perusing these

378
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,920
a

379
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,920
year or two ago and

380
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:14,520
They were there's just some really cool stuff and you can get some pretty cool shaders that people have done

381
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,000
There's a lot of you know available shaders

382
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,040
With like demos and and cool stuff I

383
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,280
I like writing shaders, but I do like

384
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,600
Checking out what other people do because lots of other people are way better at shaders than I am

385
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:34,080
I don't even I don't even really use shader graphs. I I

386
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,840
Find them too cumbersome for me. I like to hand type it but I

387
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,040
Hate debugging shaders. They take forever

388
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:49,840
So, yeah, I like to look at other people's shaders for inspiration and and that sort of stuff so pretty

389
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,720
dope

390
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,720
Yeah, if you have some time

391
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,240
Come in here

392
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,240
Feel free to browse through

393
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:06,640
The thousands and thousands and thousands of game engines you'll find one for every language and you'll find one for every scenario

394
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,880
Let's see what you can filter by you filter by star most fewest

395
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,320
most fewest

396
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,920
Most forks that'd be interesting and I've I'd assume it's relative to the stars

397
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
All right. Let's find out

398
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,640
Yep, good. Oh, I'm gee. I'm gooey

399
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:30,440
Coco's 2d, I guess it's a little different about the same though. I feel like those two are superfluous

400
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:39,280
Or the forks is superfluous that is the stars kind of is basically same thing I wouldn't recommend fewest stars

401
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,680
You're gonna get tons of zeros and I don't know what order those are in so

402
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,440
Recently updated it might be pretty cool

403
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,000
Coco's creator. Yeah, so if you ever get some time

404
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,920
Come out here and explore the github. There's a lot of cool stuff you can

405
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,720
Select on topics and you can select different topics based on what you're interested in

406
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:09,400
One topic that I have saved is C. I love looking through C stuff. I love

407
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:14,960
getting ideas from from C and look here's OBS

408
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:24,520
But I love just looking through C stuff since it's my favorite language lots of good stuff in there so check it out play around and

409
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,360
Send me if you find if you find some cool stuff

410
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:34,720
Send them my way. I'd love to look I love looking through this stuff. Like I said

411
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,360
So I

412
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,480
Think you know we're coming to the end of this and one of the things that

413
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,360
There's one other thing that bothered me. Hey, I

414
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,840
I'd strongly dislike to end on a sour note, but it's a it's a goofy one to me

415
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,920
There's there's this

416
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,320
Article that was posted and bothered my wife to where I

417
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,520
Don't know if it's called a straw man argument or a gas lighting or what?

418
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,840
But it was about not being able to play Zelda

419
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,960
inside of the

420
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,440
You know Legend of Zelda series. I know

421
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,360
Ironically, you don't play Zelda and Zelda you play as Lincoln Zelda

422
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,480
and I

423
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,440
Don't think this is they made it seem like everyone's gonna be playing Zelda

424
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,440
They made it seem like everybody

425
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:32,040
Everybody on the planet was wanting this to happen and you could play a Zelda and tons of games

426
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,040
You can play in Zelda, you know Super Smash you can play in Zelda as

427
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,320
What was it called Hyrule Warriors you play Zelda and like tons of like offshoot games

428
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,000
So, I don't know if she's in Mario Kart now she might even be in Mario Kart

429
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,440
I don't understand the need for people to

430
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,520
Come up with problems. Maybe it's because

431
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,240
They're being paid to write articles

432
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,440
And so they've got to figure out how to

433
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:03,600
Spend their day doing something and so they come up with these weird ghosts that they have to chase

434
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
and the way they word it is like

435
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:11,680
Everybody on the internet wanted this like with no citation of all the people that wanted it

436
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,240
I'm sure there's you know a pocket of people that want to play a Zelda and a Zelda game, but

437
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:22,040
Generally you play Legend of Zelda as link. That's how it's always been. It's a great game for its mechanics

438
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:27,080
You want to focus on the gameplay you want to focus on all of that sort of stuff. You don't want to have to focus on

439
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:34,040
character semantics and altering your story and changing your formulas just so you can play as

440
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:39,720
One of the other characters in there and they have lots of characters. It doesn't just have to be Zelda people are complaining

441
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:47,720
And I mean you could just mod the games if you really want to play a Zelda, but yeah, there's this is the

442
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,680
the article in question

443
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,360
by the gamer comm

444
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,920
Nintendo has no plans to make Zelda a playable character

445
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,280
It's a newsflash big old bold headline right there

446
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,520
No plans. Oh, how dare they?

447
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:11,320
As theories that Zelda would be playable in tears of the kingdom have proven wrong the wrong all those theories

448
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,720
I'd never heard once they're all just

449
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:20,080
And Nintendo even worst of all Nintendo doesn't plan to change anytime soon

450
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:26,080
Game that makes them millions and millions of dollars and is huge smash hits

451
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,840
They don't want to change it up and you know

452
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:37,240
Potentially alienate audiences. Uh, yeah, it's just I feel like this is I don't know like I said

453
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,720
I don't know if it's straw man or gaslight. It feels like one of those things where

454
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,800
companies point at

455
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:49,240
News people in general point at something and then they say

456
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,960
What do you think about that? And they point it and they they start asking that to like, you know,

457
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:02,000
What do you think about that and they point it and they they start asking that to like corporations and stuff like trying to get them?

458
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,880
The way on and on stuff they don't need a way in on and in my opinion Nintendo

459
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,440
They make tons of money. They have the IP solid. It's a fantastic

460
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:15,880
Like everybody loves the characters. Everybody loves the the storyline even though it repeats

461
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:22,160
It's it's a formula that works that people really like they focus on link doing these interesting game mechanics. So

462
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,520
But yeah, they're saying like

463
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:30,320
However, yet again is not the case yet again. Oh, no

464
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,440
Every single time I'm let down every time I sell the game comes out. It's a smash hit and

465
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,840
I'm always thinking about why couldn't I play Zelda?

466
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,760
Yeah, it's

467
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,800
It's a they even mention

468
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,880
That here we go. Unfortunately has been

469
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,040
That has many fans wondering if Zelda these many fans. I don't know where they are

470
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,440
Maybe they meant to put in my ni mini fans a small group

471
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:04,560
Of her playing in the mainline game and that's the thing is like why does it have to be mainline game?

472
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,920
That's why it's like you wanting to make Facebook or something

473
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,680
What's app I just remembered the chat app. That's like saying you want to put what's up on the front page of

474
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:21,040
Facebook it is I don't know, you know, a lot of people use it or like it so might as well

475
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:26,440
Swap out your main thing for that. It doesn't make much sense business-wise

476
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,840
You you kind of follow the money when you're in a business if you got a formula that works

477
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,320
Especially that's growing as big as Zelda does

478
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,120
Which I think is like their biggest title

479
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,760
You don't go tweak in that much you you make better games

480
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:49,080
Mechanics games are about the mechanics games are not about the characters games are not about the stories both of those things

481
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:56,600
Make games better, but that's not what games are about. They're about what the player does the games are about the player

482
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,920
Everybody has to get that in their their minds. The game is for the player and

483
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:08,560
Is about the player you don't need to pressure them into worrying about all these things. They don't need to worry about

484
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:14,040
You don't need to pressure them into worrying about all these things. They don't need to worry about just let them have fun playing their game

485
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:23,000
Okay, so that was my rant on this particular article, sorry whoever you are this person

486
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,040
This is

487
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:31,320
This is dumb the waste of I I don't like these kinds of

488
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:38,120
These kinds of articles that point at random ghosts and say why isn't that the way it's I think it should be

489
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,200
You know so anyways I

490
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:49,280
Haven't played by the way just a side note. No, don't spoil anything for me. I have not played the new Zelda game. I

491
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,040
Can't play it. You see I'm about to have a baby

492
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:57,120
I'm very excited about this baby, and I can't get sucked into a video game

493
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:03,640
Just as I'm about to have a baby. She'll be here any day now, and I probably won't be able to play

494
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,960
This is all that unfortunately, and I really do want to play it

495
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,680
I probably won't be able to play it for a few months until you know, she's stable

496
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:16,400
You know, my wife is all healed up and feeling better. I

497
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,160
I've already got a child to I'm gonna be looking after my son

498
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,720
Basically the whole time

499
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,280
because he's he's fairly young and

500
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:33,320
They're they're pretty close in age I can say so I'm gonna have my hands full and I

501
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:38,360
Though I really want to play this game. I'm gonna have to hold off on it. So no spoilers for me

502
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,640
Don't tell me anything

503
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,920
You can tell me what you like in general the public stuff like hey, I like

504
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,480
building cars and

505
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,180
trees and spaceships or whatever you but

506
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:55,500
Don't spoil any of the like mechanics. They haven't already kind of exposed or anything like that

507
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:59,380
I I like to go in blind on these things. In fact, I

508
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:02,460
goofy story I

509
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:08,260
I like all the side things in games. I haven't even finished beating breath of the wild

510
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:11,580
I've done everything like mastered all the cooking stuff

511
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:19,020
I've got all the best clothes and the last thing that I need to do is beat the final boss, which is Ganon

512
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,740
And presumably I have I like I said, I don't spoil myself on this stuff

513
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:27,740
I haven't even beat him yet because I did everything else and

514
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:33,940
There's a few things I haven't done I something I like to do like there's a few of the

515
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,180
Shrines I haven't completed

516
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,860
so something I like to do is I like to

517
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:45,280
Do all of the side things and then beat the final boss because then it's like a super completionist feeling moment

518
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:51,740
it feels incredible the downside is six years later have to be the boss, but the upside is it feels amazing when I do and

519
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:58,460
Because one of the one of the things that I feel suck is is if you finish the game

520
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:01,980
Beat the boss and then there's a bunch of side things to do

521
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:07,020
It feels like it's in backwards order like I feel like you should do all of the adventuring

522
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:11,340
Before you beat the penultimate boss and then say I'm done

523
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,980
That's just me though. I'm sure

524
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:18,740
But that's just what I like to do in games. So games like Grand Theft Auto

525
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:23,540
games like I don't even know what the main story quest is and

526
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:27,900
Things like Skyrim. I have no I have no idea at all

527
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:34,560
I just I just get plopped in the world and I do everything but the main story. That's just how I am. So anyways

528
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:41,960
That's my thoughts and thanks for watching I guess I'll see you guys in the next one have a good one bye for now
