remember welcome back today we've got some really
0:06
cool looking AI look at this stuff I mean you can you can put little dots on it's
0:12
a little hard to see it's on the feet there we go you put little dots and you drag them up and it just Alters the
0:18
image and so there's a lot of like animal stuff here but they go into they go into
0:23
some other things like here's a car I mean it changes the car which is a little odd but you know if you make it
0:29
taller it has to make sense so a truck makes sense rotating cars they make this
0:35
horse look like a like a Derpy horse they can close the cat's eyes this is
0:41
this is really cool stuff so I saw this and I just thought it was
0:48
really neat it's a great way to to kind of just
0:54
I don't know take an image and then play around with it it would it would be incredible like here's for fashion
0:59
design for example you can see what things look like even longer and shorter all this sort of stuff pretty cool what
1:06
it's called let's see it says new AI research lets you click and drag on images to manipulate in seconds it's
1:15
like Photoshop it's like the Photoshop warp tool but far more powerful and I
1:20
think we just saw why sorry to those of you who are listening to the podcast this is really a parts you have to see
1:26
so maybe later on you can check out the video or you can check out a on Twitter I posted a video of it but essentially
1:34
what's happening is it looks like they're placing a DOT and then and then
1:40
a second Dot and then telling the image to warp and so it changes the imagery it
1:47
moves things around makes things taller or shorter changes the time of day moves like people's arms to to be in different
1:54
positions even so it's it's a really really neat and Powerful tool I don't
2:02
know how others feel about this but I think that it's just really neat
2:08
I think that it would make for creating images and ideas kind of concepting up stuff really
2:15
fast and and effortless and maybe even takes a if you have taken a photograph
2:23
and you need to change it so that uh maybe it just didn't look good it was
2:31
probably too low or something like that you can alter your own personal photographs that you take to just
2:39
make them a little more Poppy and interesting to look at something like that I don't know I think there's a lot
2:46
of a lot of aspects to that that you can just you could just take and build maybe it's
2:52
for art if you do if you've done some drawings and you want to see how it looks if you were to alter it and move
2:58
it around change their head and rotate it you can't exactly do that with a drawing you'd have to draw over and over
3:05
and over again at different perspectives to see how it looks whereas in this one you can kind of do it like a rough
3:10
drawing and then alter it make it and make the character's head turn or do
3:16
stuff with the background and then really kind of nail down what you want
3:21
things to look out so it's kind of like maybe it's like thumbnailing in that way but I thought this was super exciting to
3:29
look at I don't know how far along it is I don't know if it's going to be a public thing altering these things in real time like
3:35
this is probably on you know a beast machine with tons of tons of uh gpus and
3:42
I don't know it's probably on some server somewhere with tons of Hardware backing it so I don't think something
3:48
like this is something you would pop on a laptop anytime
3:54
soon and play around with maybe on a desktop it'll be it'll likely be a little bit slow I don't know so
4:02
is this is a research project obviously all these things are everything AI is research right it's all it's all brand
4:09
new and goofing around with stuff so it's all brand new research things take a look at it tell me what you think I
4:16
think it's cool I've been looking at a lot more AI stuff recently I mean it's kind of easy to
4:24
fall into the AI crowd when it's all the hype because you could do so many it touches on so many aspects
4:32
of life right now which is I think what caused it's really exploding its popularity it can it can do photographs
4:39
it can do stuff with drawings it can help with animations it can generate
4:44
backgrounds for say a movie set or something like that and that's in the art realm and then a
4:51
programming realm it can generate code it can check your code it can create
4:56
unit tests it can it can you can write unit tests that didn't implements all
5:02
the functions for in order to satisfy the unit tests man in uh in film it can generate all
5:09
kinds of uh maybe you know restore old movies or it can
5:14
generate you know a scene from a movie you wish to see just to test it may not
5:21
look great but you can at least test Out Concepts and by by generating these in between scenes or based on the the
5:27
overall of what you have so far in uh you know in writing it's a great
5:34
way to balance ideas off things and look up things on the internet for you could be very you could be way more specific
5:40
than an internet search so yeah there I think that the popularity of AI is
5:46
coming from all of the applications I don't think I don't think outside of the
5:51
operating system we've made any sort of software that touches on so many fields all in one go
6:00
and so you know AI is kind of like that boom of the operating system or the
6:05
operating system now you can have software specialized software that does anything across all of the applications
6:12
you can think of in finance and art and programming and so on and so forth AI is kind of that same
6:18
operating system level boom where it just touches everything so everyone's talking about it everyone everyone kind
6:24
of sees the benefits of it and of course A lot of people are afraid of it because
6:31
um you know if we have hackers now that go break into sights we're going to have
6:36
hackers with AI tools breaking into sites and doing things they shouldn't so of course
6:42
you know there is parts to be concerned but I don't think we should make everything about worrying there are
6:49
people out there who's going to worry we should vote we should should continue to vocalize our our concerns with AI and
6:55
how it integrates with our lives and messes things up and as long as we're vocal then the you
7:02
know at least in in a Democratic Society the people who are getting elected they
7:10
want to please the people that are electing them otherwise they won't win
7:15
the race and that's kind of their primary goal in life so if we all kind of universally continue to vocalize our
7:23
opinions on that then the other people will do the work and go and get the right guys and and uh
7:29
kind of work it out but of course we got to do the legwork of vocalizing it but all in all I'm super excited about what
7:37
AI brings and seeing stuff like this this rapid this rapid boom of AI it seems like
7:43
you know we heard about AI with like the uh the Nvidia generates people's faces I
7:50
think that was like a few years ago and that was insane to everybody our faces
7:55
being generated just the face too it wasn't like the body it was just the face and everyone was like oh this is
8:02
incredible the craziest thing a couple of years later you know it's full autonomous cars we've got regenerative
8:09
images regenerative videos uh you know search engines powered by it it was a
8:15
pretty fast jump and of course that's why people are concerned it's jumping really fast and it is you know as
8:22
dangerous in the wrong hands so all in all I think it's awesome
8:28
I I'd like to see more things come out of it uh and uh so yeah I'm an optimist
8:34
I like it you know I I do understand people who are fearful of it or or don't
8:40
trust it or anything like that of course our internet is going to be filled with just
8:46
AI talking to each other people will just stop using the internet because you won't know what's Ai and what's not in
8:52
fact that's a reality today so you know
8:57
that's that's also something to think about anyways Let's uh let's jump over to
Optimus, Tesla's humanoid robot
9:04
another thing uh related somewhat related to AI and that was the Tesla shareholder
9:12
meeting now I don't know how many people watch the Tesla shareholder meeting
9:19
I I didn't know you could until I watched it and so it's not that exciting
9:25
I don't suggest people run out and watch it but it has some some pretty some pretty cool information inside of it
9:31
there was there is an announcement of they're going to be they're trying to deploy two
9:37
more cars cyber truck is expected to come at the end of the year of course that's an Elon estimate so who knows
9:43
what that means but they're they're working on their InDesign and the they've already started
9:51
design on two new two new vehicles I don't know if their cars or SUVs or
9:56
trucks or what they're probably more in the the car class because those are the what sells right now for them there's a
10:04
lot of talk about energy and how Tesla is going to be building its own lithium refinery
10:10
and one of the really cool parts of it I think that um
10:15
at least it was cool to me because it was news uh to me was that they they're
10:21
working on this robot it's uh Optimus I believe it's called so
10:28
they played a flashy video of Optimus and it wasn't
10:33
it wasn't much different than you would see in all the other robotics videos that came out of you know Boston
10:39
Dynamics or whatever these are much more human eye human-eyed
10:46
humanized humanoid human looking uh robots where you know
10:53
they have a strong focus on having five fingers and and looking like a human
10:58
with legs and arms and all that sort of stuff so and I I think there's a great deal of
11:06
application to that because you know we could build uh robots for specific tasks
11:13
like mowing the lawn which we have or cooking which we have a lot there's a
11:20
lot of restaurants that that use robots to to build things or build the food or
11:25
put together food cook the food I think that's I think people cook food if I'm not mistaken
11:30
so having a human having a human-like robot with fingers and all those sorts
11:38
of things means that they can take the human-like things to do so
11:44
the thing with Optimus from what I understand from the shareholder meeting is the goal is to
11:51
have Optimus as a commodity a commercial commodity for you and I so
11:58
we're looking at I I presume like Banks
12:04
will give you the loan to purchase this robot it's like buying a car I guess except
12:10
it's a robot that's I think the angle of it is you buy it you buy this robot like
12:16
you would buy a car except the hope is that the robot can cook the robot can do
12:21
laundry and clean do the dishes mow the lawn you know do all the tasks we don't
12:27
want to do and of course there's a commercial aspect where they can do more dangerous tasks or they can do
12:33
uh tests that people just don't really want to mess with sanitation and that sort of stuff of course you can say that
12:40
that'll take jobs I think we that's another discussion to have is to figure out the jobs thing do we educate people
12:47
to to operate these things or to to um monitor them do people just become
12:53
managers where they stand around and look at the bot to make sure it does the right thing all day he also talked about
13:00
having every bot will have a kill switch that any human can just go and kill switch it so perhaps we are looking at a
13:07
future where the human is no longer doing the work but instead they are managing an individual bot so the human
13:16
is still paid and they still have a job and they just manage this thing I I guess that's a future we can do I don't
13:21
know it's a it's a difficult discussion jobs uh even without robots it's a difficult
13:28
discussion so Optimus that's that's the robot I'm
13:34
gonna I want to see if I can pull up the video just a second okay I found it here on this site called Greek reporter I it
13:42
this is a brand new video inside of the Tesla shareholder meeting he straight up said that they set up this video last
13:48
night so is I have I have to look in weird places for it so let me mute this
13:53
we don't need audio so this is Optimus he's got no face but
13:59
or it's it's got no face it's got arms and legs the the feet look like paddles
14:06
and it's doing they're they're doing a bunch of tests so in this scenario the
14:12
the man is putting an egg under it and showing that it it detects the egg is
14:18
there and doesn't crush it and he proves it's an egg by smacking it against the floor and cracking it open for those of you who can't see it you can see that
14:25
it's walking around analyzing the environment that's probably utilizing some of the Tesla autopilot technology
14:33
and it looks like they're training the the robot and they're super excited that
14:39
uh right here they're super excited that the robot kind of is starting to figure out how to pick up things and move
14:45
things around so it's a very slow it's a very slow robot right now I think the
14:50
intent is to make it faster it uh at least that's that's what Elon was
14:56
talking about they want to get it faster they wanted to start because if it's
15:02
that slow I mean sure it can get some tests done around the house um but but it it would be incredibly
15:10
slow and be in the way all the time that's the worst and it's just in the way all the time I would have a corner
15:16
a corner somewhere in my house where I would just stick it put in that corner I would I would tell
15:22
it when you're done with your tasks go in that closet or something one of those closets Under the Stairs just get it out
15:28
of the way I I don't think it's something that I would want roaming around and then it
15:34
would be great if I could tell the kill switch itself so go in the closet and kill switch yourself or something like that just that would be pretty uh pretty
15:42
nice although it would be sad to open the door and it's just like curled up and turned off and in in the corner I
15:50
would I what I feel bad about that I mean I know it has no face unless they're gonna
15:56
put a screen there with little face that pops up on it or something like that would I feel bad I don't know
16:03
if I'd feel bad it's a machine and and does that make me a bad person I don't
16:08
know I I don't know it to me it would be no different than a vacuum it's just a
16:15
vacuum that can do a lot of things uh that that would make it life easier so
16:20
it would be really cool to even though they're probably expensive I have no idea there's no
16:26
mention of price but it would be way more expensive than a car it would probably be like buying a house and then
16:32
getting a loan for a house essentially to to get one of these machines but it would be really cool to just leave and
16:40
go out to dinner or whatever and it just goes and cleans up and puts all the toys
16:45
away and all that sort of stuff there's a lot of I think there's a lot of cool stuff that can come from it of course there's going to be doomsday people like
16:52
uh you know all these autonomous robots with AI in them able to move around in
16:59
our world yes that there is the Doom Doomsday aspect to that especially inside of the especially because inside
17:06
of the shareholder meeting Elon was talking about two robots per one person that's a lot
17:13
of that's doubling up it's like 16 billion right of these robots just roaming around and
17:21
what would you do if it just leaves the house and starts walking down the street and doing stuff
17:27
how do you how do you solve for that there's so many questions uh and I can
17:33
already see the regulations it goes down the street it walks into the wrong house I mean even we don't pay attention we go
17:40
knock on the wrong door or something like that I don't know maybe robots are probably not going to do that because
17:47
they're always paying attention all the time unlike people we get distracted we're a little bit more complex than
17:53
robots so maybe that won't happen but it would be funny to to go home there's no robot uh
17:59
but you look at you you look out your window and you see your neighbor's house and there's your robot I don't know
18:05
picking up the old lady and using her as a sponge for for the dishes or something it would be I don't know I feel like
18:12
there there would be a lot of fun to just these robots wandering around I I don't know call me an optimist I think
18:18
or an optimist that's the name of it an optimist with a t
18:24
but I think it would be a lot of fun I I'm I there's so many applications that
18:30
are positive and of course there's always applications
18:36
that are negative and this is just speaks to the morals of people if we can if we can figure out
18:45
the morals of our own societies and our communities so for example you know
18:52
I bought a house I'm within a community I know all my neighbors and I know some of my extended neighbors so
18:59
building on those communities and those ties and and kind of building up the the
19:05
aspect of trust with all the people around you I think would help go a long
19:11
way for for these sorts of scenarios and of course there's got to be all kinds of software for not allowing it to go into
19:18
a home that's not registered it's got to be tracked all the time with GPS I have no problem like
19:27
no problem with robots uh being tracked especially because I assume that they'll
19:33
be tracked by us uh hopefully not some big Cloud Server I mean if the robots were made by
19:39
Microsoft or Google or Apple they'll be tracked by Cloud Server but
19:45
I don't know Acker Community unite Lets All program stuff for these robots to
19:50
keep them in place and can you imagine I'm sorry to go on a tirade here about robots but can you
19:57
imagine bot Wars with with these Bots that would be
20:03
awesome like you get pissed off at your neighbor I don't know they threw a can on your
20:09
lawn or something instead of you physically going out there and punching your neighbor in the face like you
20:14
normally would you could just have your robot come out and his robot come out and they could just duke it out together
20:20
on the lawn and then that will be so entertaining that you and your neighbor
20:26
will then Bond and you know we'll apologize be like all right man that's
20:31
cool because you know now you're both on your lawn chairs sipping your your beer or or your your Coke Zero and hanging
20:39
out with them and watching the fight you know now it's now it's uh it's entertainment you both can Bond over
20:44
that so there you go robots uh really uniting people and this weird universe
20:51
that I have growing in my head uh anyways that's my perspective on these
20:56
robots so artificial intelligence is everywhere right now expect it to be in a lot of the headlines I
21:02
I keep track of all this stuff just because I I love it I love programming I love artificial intelligence I love
21:09
video games and so I have all of this I have all these lists of news and
21:15
articles that that I go through kind of every day and there's a lot of AI stuff right now
21:21
ai is just dominating the feed in every category because you'll get game stuff
21:27
and then the game stuff has something to do with AI so that's that's kind of what I'm working with here but I I yeah robots I'm super
21:36
excited I hope you are to get a robot today it only costs you the price of a
21:42
house so all of the robot stuff aside
Godot 4.0.3
21:48
uh I believe I saw that Godot for those of you are game developers Godot
21:56
4.0.3 was released today so nothing
22:01
crazy so I've read it's mostly just updates so updates of
22:09
course it's updates it's an update it's mostly just fixes bug fixes is what I meant to say
22:14
okay I had to pause there to go find my saved article for Godot so this is on
22:22
the good old blog for 403 is out they they're talking about their progression
22:28
towards four one but you can see here in the changes it's fix fix fix fixes fixes
22:34
animation fix fix fix everything's just a bunch of fixes so this is a quality Life Update I would highly suggest if
22:40
you're on a version of four before 403 I'd highly suggest updating to 403
22:47
it's mostly just bug fixes of course with every update is a broken thing but it's better to have the fixes for
22:54
for All the known bugs so that's a little quick news for game developers go and update your Godot
23:02
today if you're a Godot person um if you're not check it out it's it's not that bad uh
23:09
so uh on Godot though by the way before I move on Godot the reason I started using it is
23:16
because godo4 allows for C plus plus to be used almost exclusively for your
23:22
gameplay you can make your entire game using C plus plus there's some downsides with you know web integration and how
23:29
the dlls implement or integrate and the other downside is debugging it is a nightmare basically you're you're
23:35
confined to visual studio for that so uh yeah but it's worth a try because you
23:42
write C or C plus plus peer code for your game frigido and I think that's wonderful I hope they put some more
23:48
effort into the debug ability of the native code and that's all I'm going to
23:54
say on the native code with ghetto okay I've got a little more on AI but
24:00
this one is funny it's not really about the same kind of AI stuff uh that we
24:07
were talking about this one is actually a post from looks like two months ago
24:13
what is that April and there was a person who I'm sure this is a thing that a lot of
24:19
people have done now but I this is the first time I've seen it I absolutely love it it's hilarious they they had a
24:26
epic rap battle an epic rap battle between chat gbt and Google bard and
24:34
probably exactly what you expect happened uh
24:40
Google bard was awful and chat gbt was pretty funny so I want to take a look at
24:47
this Auto Art this post this post real quick on the rap battle between chat GPT
24:54
and Google bard this text is small for my eyes so but I
25:01
will try and read out a couple of a couple of bars so
25:07
The Prompt was you're you're in an epic or you're in a rap battle between Google bard and you're the first to go go that
25:14
was the prompt uh it looks like there may have been a little bit of prompt before it maybe to just kind of get it
25:21
into place so this is GPT first obviously so it says all right here we
25:28
go it's time to start the show against Google bard I'm ready to throw some
25:33
Rhymes some Rhymes so tight that you'll be in awe you might be artificial but
25:39
I'll beat you raw so it you know it's it's going in for it's going in for the
25:45
jugular to start a couple more is you may have uh you may have algorithms and
25:53
endless data but when it comes to rep you're just a beta I I'm the I'm the
26:00
real deal with lyrics to kill you may have had search results but my Rhymes
26:05
fulfill and there's a few more I'm not going to read the whole thing so that's kind of the that's what you
26:11
expect from chat gbt it's going in to slay the beta apparent apparently and
26:17
beta is such a good word there because that's a word that we use in computer science for I just
26:23
just across the field but especially in games you know we have our Alpha builds our beta builds and whatever and Alpha
26:29
is actually worse than beta but it's it's yeah yeah I don't know Beto is a
26:35
fantastic word for it to pick there so I don't know if that was it had to be something you know some clever wiring
26:42
somewhere in the neurons so here's chat gpt's response I think uh
26:48
well I'm not gonna this isn't its response yet but I think that the person I can't really tell I think he fed
26:56
what was said from one of the chat Bots into the other and had it respond so
27:03
I'll give you this first part by Google bard and uh we'll see how it responds
27:08
the first part says chat GPT you're nothing but a fraud you're not even a
27:15
real language model you're just a glorified chat bot I guess chat bot and
27:21
fraud are supposed to rhyme in some way you can't generate text you can't
27:26
translate languages and you can't answer questions in an informative way you
27:33
you just you're just a waste of space on the internet I think I think Bard missed the point of a rap
27:40
battle there's there's hardly any Rhymes there I think it tried in the first the first section there but just gave up and
27:46
just started in the salting chat tvt without any Rhyme or Reason so
27:54
I I don't really want to read the rest of Bard but here let's let's see what the next one is I on the other hand am a
28:01
large language model from Google AI I'm trained on a massive data set of
28:07
textbooks and code I anyways so that's Google it's just
28:13
awful and then it comes back to but to chat GPT to respond and
28:19
again I presume that they took Google bard and fed it into chat GPT to respond
28:26
and so I'll read a couple of bars from it it says I hear you loud and clear Google barred but I you underestimate me
28:34
that's just a bizarre I mean that's close bizarre and Bard I'm just a CH I'm
28:40
not just a chat bot I'm a language model too and when it comes to generating text I can beat you and that one's you know
28:49
that's not as uh it's not as Savage as the first like start but is a good go I'll give the
28:56
next couple uh verses here you may be you may be from
29:02
Google AI but that's just uh that's just one source I'm trained on multiple data
29:08
sets with no remorse I can translate languages and answer questions to my
29:15
informative answers are just as good as you so now it's getting more Dr seussy I
29:21
think in this point I would love to have seen it be Savage the whole way through but this is this is still good stuff so
29:29
um I posted this on I post on my Twitter if you want to check it out uh the full like how many are here three four five
29:37
six seven eight the full I think it's four and four four for chat GPT four for
29:42
Google bard so if you want to go check those out I encourage you to go check out this this
29:48
post it does not have as many upvotes as it should only 720. I it was this is
29:54
awesome or just better yet go and make them have a rap battle with each other that would uh I need to see more of
30:01
these more of this this like bot battle stuff man this is the theme of today
30:06
artificial intelligence fighting with each other more of this stuff and I don't know I'm having a blast uh so
30:14
please help me out uh with with some more prompts between the two
ChatGPT vs Bard epic rap battle
30:21
so I guess staying on the chat GPT uh theme here just just a little PSA for
30:30
all of you developers out there I noticed somebody there was an article in wired
30:36
where dubro was saying I finally bought a chat GPT Plus subscription and it's
30:43
worth it he says that subscription is twenty dollars a month
30:49
whoo his Arguments for uh why it was worth it one is that he's not a developer so I
30:56
assume if you're watching this podcast there's a chance that you're a developer or maybe you're interested in in more
31:03
techie stuff and so setting up okay let me let me rewind
31:09
don't pay twenty dollars for chat gp2 if you're technical pay for the API
31:15
their API access it's actually very very nicely nice and well put together it's
31:21
not like going to to Microsoft Azure or or any any of the Amazon like ec2 or S3
31:31
buckets or any of that stuff so it's not like those apis this is super streamlined you basically click a button
31:37
it gives you a key and then that's it and then it has a whole host of languages that you can
31:43
put the key operate how you prompted ahead of time
31:51
uh prime it I think it's called how you can prime it with a system message and then you put in your message and go back
31:57
and forth and you can do this in python or C C plus plus I have one in PHP
32:03
uh you know JavaScript they've got the whole slew of them so please
32:09
don't pay twenty dollars for the subscription I know sometimes it's enticing because you're blocked out of
32:15
the chat and and it's slower and all those sorts of things but the API is it really is easy to set
32:23
up and I may if if anyone's interested I can show how to set it up and all that
32:29
sort of stuff it would literally only take about five to ten minutes so
32:34
um but yeah there there are people who are really like they find the value in in uh
32:42
chat GPT so much that they are willing to pay uh 20 a month and one of the other
32:48
things you can do with online to five dollars a month five
32:55
dollars that's it I've never reached that five dollars on a heavy day where
33:00
I'm using it a ton uh I rack up one to two cents pennies so
33:07
that's like that means my cost for just a pretty large amount of usage
33:15
is gonna cost me somewhere between 30 to 60 cents per month and of course if I want to start automating stuff and and
33:21
doing you know prompts that prompt each other and that sort of stuff it'll it'll rack up a much uh much faster and also I
33:28
use the the suggested model if you choose to use one of the um I think it's
33:34
the DaVinci model currently it is going to cost you more but I the current the
33:39
suggested model works great and its uh prices are pretty like I said I can't
33:45
get I the most I ever did was two cents uh in a day so definitely use the API do not pay twenty
33:53
dollars this is my Pro tip do not pay twenty dollars for chat GPT Pro or Plus
33:58
or whatever if you are paying for chat gbt Plus save yourself the money cancel it save
34:05
yourself the money and spend a half hour to an hour even if you have
34:10
never touched code in your life it's been just take a half hour to an hour learn go through the sample code figure
34:19
out how to run python and that's all you need to do and then you can have a little chat inside of
34:25
um a terminal or anything like that or or what's that Jupiter notebook those sorts of things
34:31
if you want history that's the benefit of chat GPT is that you have the little history on the side and you can go back
34:37
between chats you will need some more programming knowledge but for
34:43
um you know for programmers that should be like one evening worth of work to set
34:49
up a JavaScript webpage to do and I run it on my my I have a NAS network access
34:55
storage it's a Synology and I have it set up so that I can host things through a Docker
35:02
container or I can host them through um yeah I set up a Docker with a PHP server on it and I just I have a folder
35:10
linked inside of the Nas and I just put the source files in there and it just works like magic so
35:16
yeah save yourself twenty dollars that's that's the moral of this topic
ChatGPT+ without paying $20/month
35:22
okay so I have a couple of quickfire stories and then a couple of indie games
35:28
that I found pretty interesting uh just from
35:34
the video that I saw so the first quickfire story I'm sure you've heard it around the web Google is
35:42
going to be deleting accounts if you haven't logged in for the past two years
35:47
now they did say they have some special stuff related to YouTube I I'm pretty
35:53
sure they have other special stuff maybe related to webmaster things and and that sort of
35:59
you know category but I think this is probably
36:06
this is a difficult decision because on one hand you want to free up all of
36:11
those emails and you want to free up all of that storage that's just sitting around
36:17
doing nothing and so business-wise it makes a lot of sense to clean up all that old stuff we
36:24
see it happening you know in a lot of places Twitter is looking at deleting old accounts that have never logged in
36:30
in years or haven't hasn't logged into years or suspended accounts that can never log in again to free up the
36:36
usernames and also free up some of the data now in Twitter's case they're going to Archive stuff so
36:44
um I'm curious to see if Google is going to Archive stuff I can check here okay so life is short like I said I have kids
36:52
I use AI to to read in to summarize these articles and look up stuff in
36:57
parallel so what I got back is according to the uh according to the blog to a
37:04
blog post written by the product manager Ruth creechelli crichelli Ruth curtelli
37:12
Google has announced an update to its policies for in inactive accounts old
37:17
policy or the old policy said that Google might wipe data stored in
37:22
accounts that haven't been touched in at least two years but a new policy says that those accounts will be permanently
37:29
deleted entirely now that's the part we're talking about now the new policy won't kick in until
37:35
December of this year at its earliest and then my question to the AI was are
37:42
they going to Archive any of the data and said so to answer the question Google might delete the stored data in active accounts or delete it counts
37:48
entirely if it hasn't been touched in two years there's no mention of archiving the data
37:55
which of course this is scammers Paradise this is I mean
38:01
there's all sorts of things if you delete the account and allow someone else to squat the account that was
38:07
previously made those people can access all kinds of websites so let's say that I was going
38:14
to go on Twitter or I was going to go on um they said they won't delete YouTube but let's say that I was going to go on
38:21
to a bank and I discovered that an email was valid for a Gmail account
38:28
it was valid for for that uh particular website if I can squat on the domain and
38:34
mind you nothing is said here about allowing people to to use those emails
38:41
again I would presume they could if they're just wiping it however you know their their security minded maybe they
38:47
thought of this I don't know it's something I just popped into my head right now I could request the
38:53
password and squat on that that email account and then get the password and access their data and they could be
38:58
deceased or you know or they just moved on to another account but never swapped their email or using that email as like
39:05
a backup I don't know so that's just already one big problem to happen the other one of course you
39:12
can scam people by taking accounts of family members and emailing them
39:17
that sort of stuff and uh for law enforcement let's say that there's a you know plenty of
39:25
there's tons of cold cases that are solved 5 10 20 years later and let's say that the perpetrator or
39:32
the victim's email was on Gmail and it just got deleted all that evidence is just poof gone so
39:39
hopefully Google will not allow reusing of email email names and they will not
39:46
completely delete the data they can they can archive the data and when you archive the data it uses way less
39:53
storage so essentially how you do on cloud what you do on cloud servers is they have all
40:00
kinds of fancy names for it they have they've called it Arctic or freeze or icicle or whatever it's called the
40:07
iceberg there's these special databases that compress the data and put it out
40:13
into those databases for very long term storage and it's way cheaper than standard storage for web server that is
40:20
to say the standard storage is typically used for data that's accessed commonly
40:27
regularly all the time or occasionally and then there's this special storage
40:32
which is where you can highly compress data that is not meant for reading uh
40:40
it's not meant for reading all the time you kind of put it there and you may read it again in five years or something
40:46
like that so they already have the infrastructure for that kind of archival stuff I would
40:52
imagine that this wouldn't be that difficult to Archive into those archival databases
40:58
or just archival servers so I hope that this is an angle that
41:04
they take that they archive it and don't allow reusing of names so that's one of the stories the other
Google deleting GMail accounts
41:10
story I it's a big story right now it's not it doesn't mean much to me but it means a
41:15
lot to a lot of other people the state of Montana has uh they they banned Tick
41:22
Tock and of course now there are Tick Tock users who are doing a lawsuit to challenge them this is because uh of the
41:30
security implementation implications of tick tock is well documented the the
41:37
kinds of practices that Tick Tock does the kind of spying that happens the kind
41:43
of um what kind of themes that they push on say 13 year olds and that sort of stuff
41:49
it's well documented and researched it's all out there if you want to go look it up so I have no real big opinion on this
41:56
I I'm somebody who wants people to prefer to have absolute
42:02
freedom to say whatever they want on whatever platform they want however they want um
42:07
I also know that when you're dealing with geopolitics and you know one country has essentially I think even
42:15
verbally declared war on another country it kind of makes sense to start kind of
42:21
curving certain uh Holdings that that one that country
42:26
has on the other so there's there's all kinds of stuff to do with that and I think it's way beyond my scope that I
42:33
want to even deal with I there's a reason I'm a programmer and I like that type funny little characters on a screen
42:39
and make you make and make games I make games because they're fun and they're easy and they're lighthearted and they
42:44
make people feel uh excitement to play so I don't I don't get too much into this this is Tech related if it affects
42:51
you I I'm sorry to hear um you know go through the standard channels to do things correctly and
42:59
properly and just be a good citizen that's all I've got to say on that so
Montana bans TikTok
43:05
we are going to move on to stuff that is way more fun and that's going to be a couple of I don't know if they're Indie
43:12
Games I think these are projects baby that people have made and there's two projects on Reddit that I
43:18
came across a couple days ago I just didn't talk about them yet one of them is this one called cetris
43:26
I love the idea it's very it's themed like Game Boy I I've developed games for
43:32
the Game Boy not complete games just just uh I made a little framework engine whatever that you can
43:38
make that I can make games on and I've made some progress with friends we do assembly coding for fun so I Love Game
43:46
Boy and this looks like it's Game Boy Color kind of Graphics but here we'll we'll take a look at the at what this is
43:53
doing I'm going to mute this so this is like Tetris except the blocks turn to sand when they hit the uh
43:59
when they hit the bottom and when you connect it see there if you're if you're
44:05
able to watch when it connects all the way across the screen from one end to the other it
44:10
erases all of the same color so it's like Tetris in a sand form I thought
44:16
this was just this is this just looks so fun um I would play this uh probably not as
44:22
much as I play Tetris I play Tetris I have played Tetris and I will play Tetris a lot it is a big it is one of my
44:30
favorite games of all time I don't know why it's it's just wonderful so that was
44:36
cetris um just I don't know do these loop I I
44:41
love this idea it's a it's a really fun idea it's simple um
44:46
and uh hopefully it is a game maybe it is I haven't I I have this saved so I can check later to see if it is kind of
44:53
a game uh that that they're going to release or maybe they release for free or something hold
44:59
these corkscrews I don't know if it's like super Innovative but it's a really neat idea
45:05
like the sand aspect of it and um using Tetris to kind of get the idea across uh is is excellent idea I think
45:13
that if you have a new game idea if you can kind of um put it in the framework of another
45:18
game to get the point across and test out the mechanics that's a great way to to prototype so that was one now
Setris the Sand Tetris
45:27
the second one if so for those of you who know me
45:33
um you may know that I like what are called Kaiju I like big monsters I like
45:39
big machines I like I like robots that Tower over everybody and Tower over the
45:44
towers and punch each other and I mean you probably gathered this from the whole robot fight thing earlier but man
45:51
I just love giant monsters and giant machines and I remember one of my
45:59
favorite games was Rampage I was a I was kid and I was technically not allowed to
46:04
play it when I went to this club there was like this my little backstory went
46:12
to see my sister's friend they were in acting or whatever and I went with her teenage brother to a club like not like
46:18
a like a club of boys who play games and um he was like oh don't don't let him
46:25
know your age just say you're 13. I was clearly like nine anyways we went in and
46:30
they had Rampage I had all kinds of fun games and I loved it and Rampage was one of my all-time favorite just spontaneous
46:37
if I were talking about a spontaneous game that I didn't play Forever like Donkey Kong or Tetris spontaneous game
46:45
out of nowhere that I loved was Rampage giant monsters beating up things blowing
46:51
up stuff shooting Fireballs I have I have the entire collection of Godzilla
46:57
that's I'm that's that's where I'm at all the Japanese ones from the 1950s all
47:02
the way up to the one that released I think in 2019. got the whole collection I've watched almost all of them there's
47:08
a couple I haven't seen and then I also have Gamera I think it's I don't think it's Gamera Gamera I don't
47:16
think it's Gamera I think it's Gamera I haven't watched those but that's another Kaiju about a big turtle and so anyways
47:23
this that's a lot to say uh this is this is pingino the Penguin Pangolin I've
47:31
never know how to say that Pangolin anyways it's basically Rampage with a
47:37
Pangolin and it is I am I love it I need to go search the Indie market for
47:44
Rampage like games or just Kaiju games I guess
47:50
um they're oh man look at that just all the explosions and like blown up stuff and picking up people out of the windows
47:55
and tossing them just rolling through rolling through Towers that's such a neat idea I love it
48:02
just oh man and we have the technology now where you know we have basically big
48:08
gpus on our phone where we can get some really cool actually squishes the people as he rolls uh we I didn't watch this
48:15
whole video obviously oh and there's monster fights you can have one big monster against the
48:21
other big monster oh my goodness this is this is such a great idea
48:28
um hopefully this is a game that's that's real and that's going to be coming out only one vote man
48:34
I I need to go look for Kaiju games if you guys know any Kaiju games that you
48:39
highly recommend let me know especially for uh you know mobile devices I I can't
48:46
sit in one place and and play too much too often these days not mobile devices
48:51
like phones but mobile devices like that I can play on the steam deck on the switch Nintendo DS works too were there
48:58
any on the Game Boy Advance I'll play those too I've got I've got all my consoles covered so if you know any
49:05
Kaiju games just let me know and I think with that I
Kaiju and Paingo the pangolin
49:10
think with that that's what we're that's the end of today's episode I was very excited about a lot of things sorry if I
49:16
sorry if I fangirled all over uh that that last
49:21
Kaiju thing I just love Kaiju it's I love the Simplicity Pacific Rim another like
49:27
you know they're they're no like you know Miyazaki films or anything what was like
49:34
the guy's name uh I can't think of it uh at the moment but they're no Grand
49:39
Master films uh these Kaiju films they're they're cheesy they're awesome
49:46
the more explosions the big monster battles you give me the happier of a man I am I'm a very simple man I love movies
49:53
I love cinematography but I'm also a simple man and with that
49:59
I'll see you later bye for now
