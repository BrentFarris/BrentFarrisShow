There is a new AI being researched that will allow you to manipulate existing your photos, we take a look at some of the stunning examples. Tesla is making big progress on Optimus, it's autonomous robot that you'll be able to buy like a car. ChatGPT and Google Bard have an epic AI rap battle that is hilarious. I also talk about the secret to getting ChatGPT+ like features without needing to pay $20 a month. I also talk about my issues with Google deleting GMail accounts and the scams that can come out of that. I slightly touch on the TikTok problem with Montana since it is tech news, but I don't have much of an opinion. Lastly I show off 2 indie developed games that I really loved, one was Tetris themed named Setris and the other was Kaiju themed named Paingo the pangolin.

### Summary
Brent is discussing a new AI research that lets you click and drag on images to manipulate them in seconds. It’s like the Photoshop warp tool but far more powerful. It can change the image by moving things around, making things taller or shorter, changing the time of day, moving people’s arms to be in different positions, and more. It’s a really neat and powerful tool that can be used for fashion design, art, programming, animations, generating backgrounds for movies, and more.

Brent thinks it would make creating images and ideas kind of concepting up stuff really fast and effortless. For example, it would be incredible for fashion design because you can see what things look like even longer and shorter. It could also be used for art if you’ve done some drawings and you want to see how it looks if you were to alter it and move it around or change the head or rotate it. You can’t exactly do that with a drawing because you’d have to draw over and over again at different perspectives to see how it looks whereas in this one you can kind of do it like a rough drawing and then alter it to make the character’s head turn or do stuff with the background and then really kind of nail down what you want things to look out so it’s kind of like thumbnailing in that way.

Brent also thinks that this tool could be used to alter personal photographs that you take to just make them a little more poppy and interesting to look at. He believes that there are many aspects to this tool that you can just take and build. For example, if you have taken a photograph and you need to change it so that maybe it just didn’t look good or was probably too low or something like that, you can alter your own personal photographs that you take to just make them a little more poppy and interesting to look at.

The popularity of AI is coming from all of its applications across many fields such as finance, art, programming, and more. Brent thinks that AI is kind of like that boom of the operating system where now you can have software specialized software that does anything across all of the applications you can think of. In finance and art programming realms, AI can generate code, check your code, create unit tests, generate backgrounds for movies or restore old movies. In writing, AI is a great way to balance ideas off things and look up things on the internet for which you could be very specific than an internet search.

Brent is excited about what AI brings and seeing its rapid boom. He thinks that AI is awesome because it touches on so many aspects of life right now which is what caused its popularity. However, he acknowledges that there are concerns about AI such as hackers using AI tools to break into sites and do things they shouldn’t. He thinks we should continue to vocalize our opinions on AI and how it integrates with our lives so that we can work it out together.
