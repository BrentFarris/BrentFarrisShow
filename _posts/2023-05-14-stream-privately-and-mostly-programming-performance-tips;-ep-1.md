{% include video id="Cm7qaqfWA5I" provider="youtube" %}
There is no need to accidentally expose your private information and fantasies on streams or in videos. A single frame of flashing it is all that is needed to ruin lives and careers. I'll go over some ways that you can protect yourself in Windows to not get embarrassed like Atrioc, the Twitch streamer that showed deep fake content on his stream when he did an alt tab.

## The code used in this episode
```c
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
	float p = sqrtf(396);
	double q = sqrt(639);
	printf("%f, %lf\n", p, q);
	return 0;
}
```

### Summary:
Brent talks about how people who stream or record videos expose their personal information and how to combat these problems on Windows. He suggests using virtual desktops, browser isolation, and hiding file systems to keep personal information private while streaming or recording videos. Brent explains that alt-tabbing is a common way for people to switch between programs while streaming or recording videos. However, this can expose personal information such as home addresses, web searches, adult videos, and other websites. Brent suggests using virtual desktops as an alternative to alt-tabbing. Virtual desktops allow users to separate their programs into different desktops so that they can easily switch between them without exposing personal information. Brent also suggests using browser isolation to prevent browser tabs from showing history of searches and other personal information. He recommends using browser sessions to separate out different types of browsing activities such as personal browsing and podcast-related browsing. Finally, Brent suggests hiding file systems by creating a separate user account for streaming or recording videos. This allows users to prevent showing off their files and keep them hidden away from viewers.

Brent talks about programming and how to optimize code to make it faster. He suggests using a profiler to identify the slowest parts of the code and then optimizing those parts. Brent also suggests using a cache to store frequently accessed data so that it can be retrieved more quickly. Finally, Brent talks about how to use parallelism to speed up code execution. He suggests using threads or processes to execute code in parallel and then combining the results at the end.
