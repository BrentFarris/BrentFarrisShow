In this video I go over the new ChatGPT iOS app and what it is, do not fear Android people, it's not that amazing. Google Chrome is going to be suggesting corrections to misspelled, or what it thinks is misspelled, URLs. I want to show off some augmented reality software and hardware because I just love augmented reality (AR) stuff. A little bit of advice for people with "unfinished projects". Quick news including Twitter's new video length, Steam Deck's new FHD+ $100 upgrade, and StableStudio going open source. Talks about Google Chrome ending 3rd party cookies for 1% of their users coming this July. Then lastly we'll wrap things up with a little programming news and that's about the .NET preview 4 being released.
