In this video I go over the new ChatGPT iOS app and what it is, do not fear Android people, it's not that amazing. Google Chrome is going to be suggesting corrections to misspelled, or what it thinks is misspelled, URLs. I want to show off some augmented reality software and hardware because I just love augmented reality (AR) stuff. A little bit of advice for people with "unfinished projects". Quick news including Twitter's new video length, Steam Deck's new FHD+ $100 upgrade, and StableStudio going open source. Talks about Google Chrome ending 3rd party cookies for 1% of their users coming this July. Then lastly we'll wrap things up with a little programming news and that's about the .NET preview 4 being released.

### Summary
Brent talks about various news stories including Google Chrome’s ability to detect typos in URLs and Chat GPT’s iOS app. He also shares his experience with the app and compares it to Bing chat GPT. The app is very bare bones and doesn’t offer any additional features. Google Chrome’s feature is useful but can be abused. Brent also talks about his habit of typing in search queries instead of URLs to avoid typos and phishing sites.

Brent mentions that Chat GPT has an iOS app that is out now. The app asks for your date of birth and phone number when you launch it. It is essentially the same as the web version except it is harder to use. There is a voice input button that uses their whisper API for voice-to-text. You press it, talk into it, press it again, and it puts the text in the input box without sending it. Brent compares Chat GPT’s iOS app to Bing chat GPT and concludes that Bing chat GPT is better on phones because you can talk to it and it talks back with references and all this other sort of nonsense that you may or may not want. You can set its temperament too.

Brent also talks about Google Chrome’s feature that detects typos inside the URL box and makes suggestions of what it thought you meant. He thinks this feature is useful because he sometimes types like a normal person or he types in the standard way he should say with index fingers on the F and the J and thumbs on the space bar, but he still winds up tripping up or missing a key or his fingers go in a way where he tries to hit a number for example and he hits the wrong number, so he searches for whatever site he’s going to instead of typing in direct URL.
