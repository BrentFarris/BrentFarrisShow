Back in March C++ 23 became feature complete and now they are moving onto C++ 26. I go over how to read up on all the changes and some thoughts on features like C++ modules. I'll also go over artificial intelligence in general and try to lower people's expectations on what they think it is. This also takes the small look at Unity AI and thoughts on using ai in game development. Lastly I take a look at the Unreal Engine 5.2 release video and talk about it's huge changelog.

### Summary:
Brent talks about the C++ 23 standard and how it has been made feature complete by the standards committee. He explains that there is a standards committee that goes over the programming language and decides what to add or deprecate. They take requests from the community and review papers that have been submitted. Brent also talks about modules in C++ 23 and how they have finally been solidified. Modules are a way of being able to componentize your libraries and code so that it can compile faster and helps with dependencies. Traditionally in C and C++, you include a file which could be binary or an inline file which is just taking code and injecting it in almost like itâ€™s a macro. You could do some pretty hacky stuff with that and modules are a way of kind of streamlining and making things a little bit cleaner. Brent also mentions that they are working on C++ 26 which is slated to emphasize concurrency and parallelism. They are going to be focused on more on the co-routines and just in general parallel stuff.
