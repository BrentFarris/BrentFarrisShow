Back in March C++ 23 became feature complete and now they are moving onto C++ 26. I go over how to read up on all the changes and some thoughts on features like C++ modules. I'll also go over artificial intelligence in general and try to lower people's expectations on what they think it is. This also takes the small look at Unity AI and thoughts on using ai in game development. Lastly I take a look at the Unreal Engine 5.2 release video and talk about it's huge changelog.
