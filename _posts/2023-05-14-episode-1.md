Though most of this episode is dedicated to code optimizations and people working off of old programming concepts and paradigms; I also give some tips on how to hide your private information on your various screens. This is with a focus on Windows and the tools within windows to help keep your information private.

## The code used in this episode
```c
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
	float p = sqrtf(396);
	double q = sqrt(639);
	printf("%f, %lf\n", p, q);
	return 0;
}
```
