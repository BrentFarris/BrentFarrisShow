Facebook is being fined $1.3 billion by the EU for sending data to the US from Europe. Government documents leaked showing the EU is looking to end the end-to-end encrypting in messaging apps. Governments are now looking into AI for surveillance. Reflecting on those people in our societies that have to filter through all the smut on the internet to train AI. Samsung Galaxy phones with Android version 11, 12, and 13 have a security flaw you should know about. SanDisk is wiping people's external hard drives and are now working on a firmware to solve this. PyPi repository was attacked so hard that they had to shut down access to the packages over the weekend. Online programming and offline programming, what to do with it?
