### Summary
Brent talks about Facebook being fined 1.3 billion dollars for transmitting data from the EU into the United States. The EU is charging Facebook this 1.3 billion dollars because it accuses it of violating privacy rules and snooping. Brent mentions that big corporations like Facebook and Google are training AI and how data is a big thing. He also talks about how countries finding companies is a way of tax or something like that. Brent believes that legislation will change how these companies operate if they try to isolate all the servers in Europe. He also mentions that it would be very difficult for small companies to avoid that law and it kind of makes the big bigger. Brent also talks about how lawmakers in Europe want to ban end-to-end encryption totally and how many members of the EU were doing proposals to scan private messages for illegal content.

Brent also mentions that Facebook made 28 billion dollars in the first three months of this year and that 1.3 billion dollars is probably the GDP of some small country. He believes that ultimately this fine won’t make Facebook change how they do everything because it’s just what they would consider a cost of doing business.

Brent also talks about his personal views on privacy and security. He is a huge advocate of not giving your information to big corporations and also not giving them basically everything about your life. He thinks that our privacy is a commodity to big companies and advertising agencies and AI training people. People who train AI are definitely gonna be the new people who want your data by the way and Facebook is one of those people training AI.

Finally, Brent discusses how lawmakers in Europe want to ban end-to-end encryption totally and how many members of the EU were doing proposals to scan private messages for illegal content. He thinks that these lawmakers have no idea what technology is and that they’ve used a phone and think they’re experts or something.
