There have been hundreds of thousands of tech layoffs just in 2023, I'll take a look at a few and give my thoughts on them. Another thing that happened at the same time as the tech companies both getting too large and then laying off tons of people was the rise of remote work (working from home). Are these two things related or are they a coincidence. I also go over N64 controller back in stock, Overwatch 2 cancels it's PVE hero mode, and TLA+.
