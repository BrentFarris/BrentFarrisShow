Valve is being sued over the steam deck by patent trolls. People who make nothing but bought up the patents for a particular technology that the Steam Deck uses is suing Valve. GPT4All is an awesome way to have local offline ai that runs directly on your laptop on Windows, Linux, and Mac. Twitter updated their messaging to be secure, but I'm not likely to swap off Signal, but it's great that they're doing that. I learned recently about super prompting to ChatGPT to get some interesting results back from the system. I have some advice for clean code, when to use it, it's strengths and weaknesses. I also have some advice on how to secure your passwords and auth tokens by not committing them to the repository. I go over exploring GitHub using both a map that someone made as well as the explore tab. Lastly I go over an article that made me mad because it was asking a dumb question about being able to play as Zelda in The Legend of Zelda main series and complaining about it.

### Summary:
Brent is the speaker in the video who talks about Valve getting sued for the Steam Deck and private chats, AI stuff, local AI stuff, clean code and GitHub. He also talks about patent trolls and secure messages. He mentions that Twitter recently released their secure messages and that he uses Signal for all his private messages with his family. He also talks about Telegram and how he likes the idea of it being locally stored on his device.
