Microsoft is one step closer to acquiring Blizzard now that the European Commission has approved the purchase. GCC 13 comes in with some new C2x features. You should really be using PHP 8 and it's type names whenever possible. A view on mental health with programmers and getting jobs as a programmer. Wrapped up with Google ethical AI nonsense with images and a neat indie game video I saw named SWAP.

### Summary:
Brent talks about the latest news in the game industry consolidation and how it affects developers. Brent mentions that there is a lot of noise in the game industry with many games being published on Steam and app stores on both IOS and Android. With all that noise, it’s really hard for people to punch through it and become successful. A lot of them have to go through YouTubers and YouTubers have a very specific show to put on so a lot of games are being kind of developed in a way that YouTubers can use them to be funny or entertaining. There’s a lot of noise in that respect. There are also many games that are getting published with unity assets store stuff they just pull some stuff off the asset store they pay a few bucks for throw it all together do some very light coding and then they put out a game in less than a week and sometimes they’re really successful on YouTube.

Brent then talks about how big companies have the money to push their games to push their products. They can market to millions of people, they have hundreds of millions of dollars to put into marketing and research and influencer campaigns. Lots of influencer campaigns, a lot of streamers are paid to play those games to promote them and sometimes he doesn’t even know if the streamers even mentioned that they are paid to promote them. With all that madness, big companies get bigger, they spend a lot of money to make a lot of money and then they spend that money to buy up all the other medium-sized businesses. Brent mentions that he is ambivalent about big companies buying up other big companies or big companies buying up medium-sized companies. He thinks the consolidation just happens maybe it’ll lead to some kind of tipping point where people get tired of it maybe developers will get tired of making stuff. Brent then talks about how GCC 13 now supports C2x stuff and some of the notable things that people like to point out is null pointer which comes from C++ that one he is iffy about doesn’t really matter to him he’s fine with null. This null pointer makes it a little bit more explicit better compiler support that sort of stuff it’s not just a macro that evaluates to zero so that’ll allow some better compiler checking for things like that. Enhanced enums oh also for null pointer not only for compilers but kind of what are they called static analysis tools.
