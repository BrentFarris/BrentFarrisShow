1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Hello, and welcome to the first episode of whatever this might be.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,480
I think I'm going to call it overnight assembly, because I like assembly programming.

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,760
It's one of those languages that are just a lot of fun to program in, and I do it at

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,160
night, so maybe that's what I'll call it.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,840
Generally, what I want to talk about here maybe is my perspective as a programmer on

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:35,240
technology and computers and games and code and repositories and libraries and game engines

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,520
and whatever else.

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:43,360
I have a lot of opinions about a lot of things, but I also like to get the opinions of others

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,760
and kind of grow my understanding.

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:53,600
It is very common for programmers to be very biased about things.

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,000
We all have worked with programmers, I've worked with them for about 15 years, and we

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,320
all have strong opinions about a lot of things.

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,080
So I want to try not to be strongly opinionated.

14
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,120
I've changed a lot of my opinions over the years, and I feel like they're going to change

15
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:17,240
a lot more as we go, or as I go, on programming.

16
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,760
So yeah, that's kind of the general overview.

17
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,720
I also want to talk about games, I love games.

18
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,880
I have thousands of old games and new games.

19
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:34,080
I have a whole collection of almost every system, maybe, maybe half the systems, I don't

20
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,080
want to say that.

21
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,600
There's some that I don't have, just I collect a lot of the ones I'm interested in, and I

22
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,680
go on a spree of those type of games for a while.

23
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,280
So I just wound up with tons of games, some duplicates that I need to get rid of, but

24
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,920
there are quite a few games that I don't like because you get the games that you do want

25
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,920
instead of a lot.

26
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:02,160
Anyways, that's a topic for another day, so I'll be talking about old games, new games,

27
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:09,920
old computers, new computers, technology, who knows, just general things that I find

28
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,200
interesting in the game development and software development field.

29
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,560
So who am I?

30
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,560
I'm Brent.

31
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,200
I've been programming since about 2009.

32
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,840
I went to school for animation, so I know how to animate.

33
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,160
I know how to rig and 3D model.

34
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,240
I draw even, I do a lot of brush pen drawing and that sort of stuff.

35
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,240
But mostly I program.

36
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,240
I program a lot.

37
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,320
I've programmed too much.

38
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:45,000
I have a huge graveyard of projects because I program essentially the thing that I find

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,280
most interesting in the project and then I put it off into the GitHub graveyard.

40
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,640
Just that huge list of just things I'll probably never touch again, but it's there if I want

41
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,600
to.

42
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,080
So I'm currently a professional programmer.

43
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,080
I've been programming for almost 15 years.

44
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:13,400
I've been in web development, game programming, mobile programming, console programming, indie

45
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,640
programming, PC, all this stuff.

46
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,200
I've programmed stuff for the Game Boy.

47
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,400
I've programmed a little bit on the Game Boy Advance.

48
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,480
I've programmed a lot of third party consoles that are just, you know, people just release.

49
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,880
So just kind of, I just like programming on a bunch of different things and I love low

50
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,040
level code and I love the ease of high level code.

51
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,120
So I'm not partial to anything.

52
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,480
I bounce around quite often.

53
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:48,880
I'm currently a game engine programmer and an artificial intelligence programmer professionally.

54
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,760
So that's what I'm paid to do.

55
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:59,920
So yeah, sometimes it is hard to explain the things I'm interested in because I go all

56
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,800
over the place as you just saw.

57
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,280
But here's a not so complete list off the top of my head that I wrote down to kind of

58
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,520
explain the things that I bounce around in.

59
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,040
So there's going to be languages and frameworks and all this sort of stuff just to kind of

60
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,080
give a background of where I'm coming from and where a lot of my opinions on the future

61
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,480
episodes are going to be from.

62
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,320
This is kind of the source of my mindset.

63
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:35,100
So let's see, I've programmed in C, C++, x86, x64, the assembly languages, ARM assembly

64
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:44,320
including Thumb, 6502, the C64 and the NES variant of that, the Z80, the Game Boy variant

65
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:51,880
specifically, assembly code, C Sharp, I've done BIOS programming, GLSL, Java, JavaScript,

66
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:58,280
Python, Lua, HTML, CSS, XML, you know, those various markup languages, Bash, PowerShell,

67
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,200
OpenGL, DirectX, Direct2D, DirectWrite.

68
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:11,120
CUDA, I did CUDA for ray tracing, this little ray tracing project I did, I got like a 720p

69
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,680
rendering of like this ray traced scene at 30 frames per second.

70
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,400
It was a very simple scene, lots of spheres because spheres are easy.

71
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:27,680
And I got that done on a non, on like a 1070 or something, it was pretty nice.

72
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:34,120
I've dealt with SDL and Scriptum, Android, and Android NDK, Wasapi, if you don't know

73
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:41,360
what that is, it's a Windows audio, I forgot what the S stands for, it's not stack, it's

74
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,480
like sampling or something, API.

75
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,200
And I did that for a voice over IP thing and I was using C and I was integrating with it,

76
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:56,200
it was very much a C++ library but I was able to get like the GUID for the various devices

77
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,760
and there's a lot of GUID stuff, you just gotta get those in order to tell Windows,

78
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,960
hey, this is what I want to do.

79
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,320
So I've dealt with that, it was a very interesting kind of random project I did.

80
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:17,520
I've done network programming on Unity a long time ago, I made Forge Networking, I've since

81
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,040
archived it, I just didn't have the time to support that.

82
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:29,000
It got really popular at one point and I refactored it to Alloy but I never could finish it, way

83
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,360
too much stuff in life, including having kids.

84
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,480
That makes things a little complicated to kind of do a hobby project like that.

85
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:44,560
So I've done a lot of multi-threading, WebSockets, MySQL, Redis, Memcached, the various databases,

86
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,280
I've dealt with vertical databases as well as horizontal scaling databases like NoSQL

87
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,400
and all that.

88
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,360
Lots of, SQLite is basically the same thing, why not even put it on this list?

89
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,640
Frameworks like.NET, Node.js, game engines, I've done a lot of Unity, I've done quite

90
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:08,840
a bit of Unreal 4 and 5 now, and Godot is something I just recently started messing

91
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,360
around with, I've programmed my own game engines.

92
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,320
So that's kind of my perspective.

93
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,260
I jump around a lot, I've done a lot of assembly and low-level stuff but a lot of high-level

94
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,280
stuff in game engines like Unreal and that sort of stuff.

95
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:29,600
So I love jumping around, oh and lots of web, I've done lots of web, JavaScript stuff, JavaScript

96
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,600
games, all that sort of stuff.

97
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,960
I love to prototype in JavaScript, it's just so fast and easy.

98
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,840
And I have some libraries that I just use, I've been using modules a lot lately, which

99
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,840
is a lot of fun.

100
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,800
I do like modules quite a bit, rolling them up into a single file and all that is annoying,

101
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,360
but modules are a lot of fun, I can definitely say that.

102
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,840
So that's kind of all of that, and I kind of mentioned this, but the most important

103
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:04,960
thing about me is that I'm a father and a husband, that's what makes my life happy.

104
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:14,880
So other than that, that's kind of my whole background and kind of my perspective on opinions.

105
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:22,320
Now one thing that I'm not, unfortunately, is one of those ex-Google employees.

106
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:27,760
I'm sure you've seen all of those YouTube videos out there that are like, ex-Google

107
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,560
employee blah blah blah blah blah, it says something like that.

108
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,640
I don't know if they do that for like Clickbait or Cloud or something like that.

109
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,320
Google has a lot of employees, so I mean there's a lot of ex-employees now that are all getting

110
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,320
fired.

111
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,520
I'm sorry, I'm not attacking anyone with that.

112
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:55,920
I'm not one of those, I've never worked at a gigantic company, mainly because I don't

113
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,920
want to.

114
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:05,720
The more smaller companies, they can sometimes pay more, and also you get a lot of equity,

115
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,760
so you can get a lot in the long run out of it, versus those big companies.

116
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,600
And frankly, I've had a lot of friends who've gone to those big companies, and it's just

117
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
boring.

118
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:22,880
They say that they chill outside, they disappear for a week, and nobody even notices.

119
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:31,200
They just hardly do any work, and if they do, it's something super minor, kind of just

120
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,600
maintaining stuff.

121
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,440
There's a small group of people that actually do the hard work.

122
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,280
And of course, if you're a programmer, which you likely are, I don't know who would be

123
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,560
watching this that doesn't like to program or is interested in games.

124
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,680
You know the industry has a lot of leads and managers and those sorts of people that don't

125
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,680
really program a lot.

126
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,600
You can have a lead engineer, and they don't do a lot of programming.

127
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,280
The one that I work with does a lot of programming, but typically, especially at the big places,

128
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:05,480
you can get some that hardly ever program, ever, even on their free time.

129
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:13,560
So I'm not one of those ex-Google employees says, XYZ.

130
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:19,080
I like to do work, and I like to participate in a team.

131
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,760
Maybe there's a role somewhere at one of those places that is more research-based or something

132
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,940
like that that I can take advantage of and have a lot of fun with.

133
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:35,400
But maybe in the core, like operating system part of the business, I'm not sure.

134
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,920
But I don't have any one of those flashy name tags.

135
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,680
I've released lots of games with companies, mobile.

136
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,360
I'm currently working on a console game.

137
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,760
So I've bounced around a lot.

138
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:58,080
So I kind of want to learn more about a lot of other fields.

139
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:06,160
I've done so many things roll in my mind whenever I think about those, but we'll probably go

140
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,200
over a lot of these in future episodes, just things that are interesting in programming

141
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,240
and computers and tech and all that sort of stuff.

142
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:24,600
So yeah, speaking of those ex-Google employee gives you advice on how to get hired or whatever

143
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,000
kind of videos, I don't ever click on them, I don't know why they keep sending them to

144
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
me.

145
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,440
But I don't know if you see them, maybe it's just me.

146
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,880
I don't know.

147
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
I get a few of them.

148
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:45,840
I always have to hide the channel or whatever because they pop up.

149
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,200
It's almost like clockwork.

150
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,680
Another thing that I like to do is I like to program very small.

151
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,880
I like very small programs, I like very fast programs, I like elegant code and elegant

152
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,360
functions, very small functions, that sort of stuff.

153
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:10,000
And if you look at what these big companies produce, they produce simple libraries and

154
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,520
their apps, they have tens of thousands of classes that make up, I don't know if it's

155
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,780
like code generation or what, but they've got tens of thousands of classes, which is

156
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,440
insane to me.

157
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,760
That's a lot of something.

158
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,560
Half of them probably don't know what it is.

159
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,760
Half of them are probably third-party libraries, which is even worse.

160
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,320
And their size is huge, hundreds of megabytes.

161
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,760
And even worse, if you think about a lot of these apps, a lot of people complain about

162
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,360
Google, a lot about their apps.

163
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,300
The experience of YouTube on iPhone is different from Android, which is different from Android

164
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,800
tablet, which is different from the web.

165
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:01,280
And you'd imagine when we use web technology across devices, I know it's a little bit more

166
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,700
complicated with the iOS ecosystem and how they want to handle with all that and web

167
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:10,160
views and all that sort of stuff, it gets annoying.

168
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:17,180
But they invested millions and millions of dollars in V8 to kind of build this platform

169
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,180
they can work off of.

170
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:23,920
And their apps are just broken across, I mean, their function, but they're just missing features

171
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,520
across the different devices.

172
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,560
You know, that's kind of crazy to me.

173
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,560
Got so much money.

174
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,080
Don't you think they can consolidate it?

175
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,080
I don't know.

176
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,040
I don't know kind of what they set up.

177
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,760
I do know how most teams operate.

178
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,880
I can see how it happens.

179
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,400
But yeah, it's really fractured.

180
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,800
So that's another thing I don't really want to work with is when you go to those big companies

181
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,680
and you got to deal with cross disciplines and all this other stuff, as it's called cross

182
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,520
disciplines.

183
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,800
And you got to deal with all of like, you can't merge two things and you got to deal

184
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,600
with the bureaucracy.

185
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,800
I like small teams where you can just move around.

186
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,920
You can say, I want to work on that.

187
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,360
And they said, cool, we can figure out, you know, if it works with our product, let's

188
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,000
figure out how we get you over there.

189
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,680
That's what I like about smaller companies too.

190
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,320
It's just, it's really nice.

191
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:23,200
So yeah, I mean, so it's not just Google and software companies like that.

192
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,640
It's game companies too.

193
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:31,120
Working in game companies and kind of seeing the games that are produced is crazy.

194
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,040
Of course, it's not a fair comparison to say, look at games from the 90s and 80s and they

195
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,980
have so little bugs compared to modern games and they have, you know, they're so much faster

196
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,920
and smaller, blah, blah, blah.

197
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,680
It's not fair because there's a lot of stuff in modern games, crazy amount of stuff in

198
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,680
modern games.

199
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,960
So I give it some slack there.

200
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,120
I do believe that the programmers were much more disciplined in the past because they

201
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,420
had to be working with low level code just with no other option.

202
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:06,920
So there are differences and similarities in some aspects, but games, man, like the

203
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,240
minimum requirements for games is pretty dang high.

204
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,320
Of course, luckily computers are getting way cheap now.

205
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:22,380
So pretty much anyone can muscle through and punch through the wall of system requirements

206
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,380
these days.

207
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,640
Like you can run tons of AAA games on something like a Steam Deck.

208
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:34,200
So you know, sure, they have all the compute power to really muscle through it, but they

209
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,560
make some weird decisions.

210
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,000
Like why are games like 200 gigabytes?

211
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,520
That's crazy.

212
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:46,840
So we come up with this frame scaling technology, FSR, that sort of stuff.

213
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,320
And then you still put 4K textures in your game and your game is being rendered at like

214
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:57,180
720p pretty much most of the time or 1080p, but you're putting 4K textures in.

215
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:04,800
And then we don't know what's the amount of people that have 4K monitors versus, you know,

216
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,520
1080p monitors.

217
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,640
And I would imagine that you can kind of detect that and you can have Steam kind of upgrade

218
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,520
the game based on, you know, what kind of monitor they have.

219
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:19,440
But you can't, if you have a 4K texture and you're displaying it on a 1080p monitor, that's

220
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,880
just, it doesn't even, it's crazy.

221
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,720
Like it's bigger than the screen in resolution.

222
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:34,120
And so then you add FSR in the mix and now the 4K monitors aren't even rendering at 4K.

223
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,560
And to make the most of it, of course, you know, this is being a little pedantic because

224
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,920
you can have one texture that goes across multiple objects and you want that to be 4K

225
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,160
in order to optimize your memory and how much you're loading at runtime.

226
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,840
Yes, I get that.

227
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:55,440
But man, how many textures are actually that versus, you know, a giant 4K rock texture

228
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,400
that they just splatter on rocks?

229
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,720
It's kind of funny, I guess for stretching and stuff.

230
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,920
I don't know, I really think there's a huge waste in memory there.

231
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:13,200
And it's kind of, you know, so it's not just Google and big software companies that just

232
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,920
absolutely waste your CPU and your storage.

233
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,040
It's games too, a lot of times.

234
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,040
And I think those can be better optimized, but you know what?

235
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,080
The game is about money.

236
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,760
The game of making games is about making money for, I mean, mostly.

237
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:36,240
It's having fun is sometimes what the designers care about, even though they've got to make

238
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,120
the investors happy.

239
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,680
But 4K textures are kind of going crazy right now.

240
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:48,960
I think we can probably reduce a lot of that and rely more on the FSR stuff.

241
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:57,320
It's just, you know, I think that's, yeah, there's a whole rant there.

242
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,520
There's also, when it comes to wasting, and we're going to combine the two now, we're

243
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,440
going to take software and we're going to combine it with games and what they both do

244
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,040
wrong.

245
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:12,400
One of the things I hate, hate is a strong word, one of the things I strongly dislike

246
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,520
is JSON.

247
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,440
I mean, it's fantastic.

248
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:25,800
And the argument is always, what if we need to read it and modify it?

249
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,880
But the funny thing about that is they try to compress JSON so it becomes unreadable.

250
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,240
It's just an unreadable garbled mess because you're trying to reduce the string sizes as

251
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,600
you try to compress this data.

252
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,480
So you lose the readability and it's still bloated.

253
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,160
And then your CPU has to pay the cost of parsing it.

254
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,840
Well, first of all, serializing it.

255
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,480
So it takes this binary data, serializes it, and it's got to pay somebody else's poor computer's

256
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:58,120
going to take the cost of deserializing it, parsing it, turning it back into binary objects.

257
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,040
And then you have to also transport it across the wire.

258
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:06,280
And then we have to use compression algorithms, so using more CPU to compress that, the strings,

259
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,440
which they can get pretty compressed just with a standard zip algorithm.

260
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,120
And then you want to send that, and then you've got to decompress it.

261
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:28,960
So I have this theory that JSON files alone, like if you took all of the energy, all of

262
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,640
the power that we use in our computers and our smartphones to parse and read and do all

263
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:43,120
of that and transmit and zip JSON data, you could probably give an entire small country

264
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,920
somewhere, power for free, because that's how much is being wasted.

265
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:53,360
And then you can add up all the heat that the CPUs generate by parsing and doing all

266
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,040
that, just that cumulative over like a month or something, every device that does it, and

267
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:03,160
you could probably heat an entire small country with that amount of heat.

268
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,880
So it's a waste.

269
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,920
It's a weird thing to think about.

270
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:15,160
We complain a lot about, oh, you know, crypto mining, using tons of energy, blah, blah,

271
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,160
blah.

272
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,760
It's bad for the environment.

273
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,040
Well, you know what else is bad for the environment?

274
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,560
Using JSON files for everything.

275
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:32,120
When you can simply and easily just serialize binary, where you just take binary, make it

276
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,720
basically into a file and send it.

277
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,640
And you can do whatever compression you want if you want to, but binary is already smaller

278
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,000
than JSON.

279
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,840
So yeah, all the crypto miners wasting tons of power

280
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,840
across the planet, yeah.

281
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,360
You know what else is wasting power?

282
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,720
JSON deserialization, my goodness.

283
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,160
JSON deserialization of 4K textures.

284
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,160
Let's get those reduced and let's save the environment

285
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,580
from just taking those out of the picture.

286
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:02,080
So yeah, that's kind of my perspective on,

287
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,680
how did I get on this?

288
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,220
Let's talk about Google people on YouTube,

289
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,040
or ex-Google people.

290
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,220
So anyways, yeah, it's just super wasteful.

291
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:18,400
The entire industry is very wasteful in how they do things.

292
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,860
And I know we don't all use C,

293
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,920
but in C you can just take a struct,

294
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,640
or even a compound struct of plain old data,

295
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,680
let's say there's no pointers,

296
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,640
or even if you just write a little function

297
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,200
to get rid of the pointers.

298
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,800
I mean, I would argue that if you're gonna be

299
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,640
serializing data and there's gonna be pointers in there,

300
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,060
if you have to have them in there,

301
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,920
you should separate them into their own structure

302
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,640
so you can easily strip it out,

303
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,520
or put it as like a head and then do the offset

304
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,200
so you can find the offset of where the POD starts,

305
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,800
POD for plain old data, and then just write it.

306
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,000
But in C you can just take that struct

307
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,840
and just write to a file or across the network.

308
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,400
You don't have to do any compression or serialization

309
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,680
or anything like that, you just,

310
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,040
here's a struct, it's a set of data, and send it off.

311
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,440
And that's how much energy you'd save

312
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,400
from doing that, it's quite tremendous.

313
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,000
But I know we don't all use C.

314
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,840
I know C is, I didn't say it,

315
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,680
but C is my favorite language.

316
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,600
It's just, I love it,

317
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,180
because I can use it in a lot of things,

318
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,960
like Game Boy Advance programming.

319
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,200
So it's just nice and flat,

320
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,400
and I don't have to worry about objects,

321
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,120
I'm a very simple man.

322
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,920
But let's say you're doing C++,

323
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,080
and I do a lot of C++,

324
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,080
obviously my day job is programming in C++.

325
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:48,080
So in C++, yes, you do have a little bit of a problem,

326
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,600
because you don't have an ABI,

327
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,240
you don't have a standard for ABI,

328
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,840
so you don't know if application binary interface,

329
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,920
basically the byte order of a class or a struct.

330
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,560
So, I guess I can explain that real quick,

331
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,760
for those of you who don't know.

332
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,040
In C, you have this flat ABI,

333
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:13,000
and now I don't wanna get too much into alignment

334
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,360
and all that sort of stuff,

335
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,160
because you do have to do some work there,

336
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,960
if you're dealing with things like that.

337
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,200
If you're, say, serialize,

338
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,040
if you're sending something

339
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,280
from a 64-bit computer over to,

340
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,640
I don't know, a 16-bit computer,

341
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,120
you're definitely gonna have to do a little bit of work

342
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,080
on that.

343
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,440
But let's say that you set up your struct

344
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,800
with the proper alignment and all that,

345
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,040
in C, you could just send it straight across,

346
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,640
and knowing that maybe your smallest

347
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,560
or minimum spec is 16,

348
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,720
there's gonna be, did I say byte?

349
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,640
16 bits.

350
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,160
So, you can,

351
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,520
let's say that you want to do that,

352
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,840
I've lost my train of thought,

353
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,680
that alignment,

354
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,840
and let's say you have all that,

355
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,640
you can send it straight across.

356
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,240
Now, one of the problems you have in C++

357
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,960
is that it doesn't have that ABI across compilers,

358
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,360
and even compiler versions,

359
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,360
like if you use Clang X and then you use Clang Y,

360
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,880
it's not guaranteed that the name mangling or the,

361
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,880
which doesn't matter in this argument,

362
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,160
but the ABI is gonna be the same.

363
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,080
And that's because,

364
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,520
mainly I think it's because of the Vtable.

365
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,960
A Vtable is a piece,

366
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,640
is a block of your class for virtual classes

367
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,720
where they point to the function it should call

368
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,960
when you call a function.

369
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,240
As you know, you can create a virtual function,

370
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,560
you can override those functions in the child classes,

371
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,680
or the derivatives, whatever you wanna call them.

372
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,000
Now that Vtable could be at the top,

373
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,640
it could be right in the middle of the binary data,

374
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,040
it could be at the end of the class,

375
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,200
there's no telling where that is.

376
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,320
So just serializing and sending it off

377
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,680
is gonna be a little bit of a problem.

378
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,240
And that's where serialization libraries start coming in.

379
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,840
You have other languages where you don't have access

380
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,600
to the raw binary of the class

381
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,720
without turning on special flags

382
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,880
or whatever for the compiler,

383
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,080
like in C Sharp or say JavaScript or something like that.

384
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,520
So sending things straight over,

385
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,720
like you do in C, is not as easy.

386
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,720
And so I do understand that part of where we get into this.

387
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,400
This whole, let's JSON serialize it,

388
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,760
because then I can write my program in C Sharp

389
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,320
and then have a JavaScript client be able to read the data.

390
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,960
And I don't have to worry about,

391
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,120
I don't have to worry about Indian-ness,

392
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,720
or I don't have to worry about, you know,

393
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,520
the alignment or anything like that.

394
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,760
So yeah, it does kind of really help

395
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,680
and it does kind of reduce the cost of effort up front

396
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,600
to do those kind of like, just use a JSON library.

397
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,440
But it's so wasteful.

398
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,280
I think that if you just, it's really,

399
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,320
programs, companies have this weird thing

400
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,360
where they think that it takes months

401
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,140
to do something as simple as serializing some bytes.

402
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,840
They're like, I don't know if that fits into the schedule.

403
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,160
Man, that's a whole other thing.

404
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,000
Let's not go on that.

405
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
But yeah, I do understand that, you know,

406
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,600
it's a cost analysis.

407
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,520
No company, I can tell you this,

408
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,000
I've worked at so many different companies,

409
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,920
no company, none of them care about how much power

410
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,000
you're drawing from a wall socket to run their program.

411
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,680
And as long as it's fast and it gets the player,

412
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,440
the client, what they need.

413
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,720
Now this is a different argument for mobile.

414
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,680
In mobile, they sometimes do care

415
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,280
because they want good battery life.

416
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,040
I don't want to say excellent battery life,

417
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,280
otherwise they wouldn't use engines that drain battery life.

418
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,640
They would, you know, write their own stuff.

419
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,480
But they do care a little bit there.

420
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,180
So I'll give them credit on that.

421
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:16,180
So this brings us to things like,

422
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,280
gosh, what's it called, protobuf.

423
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,000
Okay, protobuf does help you

424
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,960
with that binary serialization.

425
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,400
Now I didn't go through the entirety of the class

426
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,280
or all the classes to determine

427
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,160
whether the binary serialization is efficient.

428
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,880
I assume it's efficient because it's open source

429
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,000
and a lot of people have looked at it

430
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,320
and probably have contributed.

431
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,400
And I do, I know I prefixed this earlier

432
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,880
about Google employees and all that sort of stuff.

433
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,880
It's not to say they're bad programmers.

434
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,480
It's just, you know, there are some bad programs

435
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,400
that come out of Google, a lot of bad programs

436
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,600
that come out of Google.

437
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,960
And it's not the fault of the programmer most of the time,

438
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,160
it's the fault of the company.

439
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,920
So they do have good programmers that do study this stuff

440
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,560
and take the effort and they do the research

441
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,480
and all this other stuff,

442
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,720
which is very important to everybody,

443
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,360
especially when you open source it.

444
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,860
So no complaints from me there.

445
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,040
But protobuf is like hundreds of thousands of lines of code

446
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:26,000
to serialize some bytes and that is huge.

447
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,720
I have this thought about libraries

448
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,080
and even programmers just inside of a company.

449
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:41,080
Programmers are often stuck to doing a specific type of work

450
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,080
on these big companies.

451
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,580
So I like to say that if you took a person

452
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:52,160
and you paid them a pretty good amount of money

453
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:57,160
and you gave them a rock in the corner of a room

454
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,420
and you said, your job is to manage this rock,

455
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,240
the best thing that person could do

456
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,960
is not do anything.

457
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,640
The rock is gonna be completely fine.

458
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,520
But chances are you're gonna come back two weeks later

459
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,200
and the rock is gonna have a little house set up

460
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,280
with a little dinner table

461
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,360
and it's gonna be laying inside of a little bed

462
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,760
with a blanket over it.

463
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,880
And then once you ask the developer how he's going,

464
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,680
he's gonna say, oh, well, you see,

465
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,080
I've optimized the living situation for this rock

466
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,320
and I've also created a Jira workflow

467
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,420
so that we can keep track of its schedule.

468
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,880
And that's just how people are

469
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,400
when you pay them a good amount of money

470
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,040
and tell them to do something.

471
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,400
They overdo it every time

472
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,040
because maybe it's because they're bored

473
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,320
and they need something to do

474
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,420
and the task wasn't interesting enough

475
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,160
so they go way off the wall

476
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,320
or maybe they're trying to prove something,

477
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,080
they want a higher salary or maybe a different position

478
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:00,080
so they really kind of polish the rock, so to speak.

479
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,320
So I feel that's the case for a lot of libraries.

480
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:07,640
You set a library out there, let's say a logging library,

481
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,160
and it does sufficiently what you need it to do

482
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,280
for your program.

483
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,640
So then all of a sudden,

484
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,000
I don't know, it gets picked up by somebody

485
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,520
on a YouTube video or something

486
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,560
and then everybody's using it.

487
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,600
All of a sudden you have half a million people

488
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,600
downloading or half a million downloads

489
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,440
of your software.

490
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,640
Half a million people downloading or half a million downloads

491
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,160
on your library.

492
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,120
You all of a sudden turn over and say,

493
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,240
man, there's a lot of people downloading this library.

494
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,960
I need to improve it.

495
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,320
And so you start going in there

496
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,440
and you start adding tons and tons of features

497
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,160
that are not needed at all.

498
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,440
Remember that you got half a million downloads already.

499
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,160
That means it does what people want.

500
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,400
Of course they're gonna come and complain.

501
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,520
The other part is, and this is not the fault

502
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,200
of the person polishing the rock,

503
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,600
this is the fault of the people

504
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,960
who are using their libraries.

505
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,200
People often think that if a library is not updated

506
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,920
in the past month or half a year,

507
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,680
it's all of a sudden just broken.

508
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,720
You can't use this.

509
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,960
It's just, ugh, it doesn't work anymore.

510
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,240
The code just rotted itself out of existence

511
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,600
from sitting there for too long.

512
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,120
I don't know.

513
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,720
And there's a lot of pressure on that

514
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,240
to keep them updating and doing things like that.

515
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,920
Now, also you have open source,

516
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,880
so you have hundreds of people sending issues

517
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,160
and also pull requests and you start accepting things.

518
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,000
It just bloats.

519
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,920
And so this is what happens with libraries.

520
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,840
And I don't think Protobuf is any exception to this.

521
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,920
I just wanna serialize some bytes.

522
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,160
And so Protobuf is quite bitty.

523
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:53,160
Here, let me look up the Protobuf here.

524
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,400
So we have the protocol buffers.

525
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,680
And I'll actually just, is this the main library?

526
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,280
Looks like it.

527
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,680
It was updated five hours ago.

528
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:12,200
This thing worked like five years ago or whatever

529
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,040
when I was using it, but it's still being updated.

530
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:20,560
And five years later, it's some serious business

531
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,720
taking some bytes and putting them

532
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,880
into a file across network.

533
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,760
And I know I'm simplifying it.

534
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,320
I've done tons of network stuff.

535
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,160
I get it.

536
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,120
Half the time, you don't even use Protobuf

537
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,280
for network stuff, so there's that.

538
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,160
But we're gonna, I'm just gonna,

539
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,560
I'm gonna grab this guy.

540
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,560
Hold on, I've gotta turn off a thing on my computer

541
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,680
that talks to me whenever I copy text.

542
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,000
Okay, so I'm gonna grab this guy

543
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,120
and we will go ahead and,

544
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,040
we'll go ahead and clone it down somewhere.

545
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,640
Put it in a document, documents.

546
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,880
Go to git, git clone that guy.

547
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,480
So we'll clone it down and let's take a look

548
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,440
at where the source code is for this guy.

549
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,240
And of course, a lot of the source code

550
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,560
is gonna be in language wrappers

551
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,080
and that might be where half the updates

552
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,640
are coming from is language wrappers, I don't know.

553
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,480
But you got C-sharp, Java, Python, Ruby, Rust, blah, blah, blah.

554
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,880
So it's probably gonna be in the source folder

555
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,400
and in this Google Protobuf here.

556
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,920
So it's still downloading, but let's take a little

557
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:42,920
Ubuntu local instance here

558
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,840
and let's go over to,

559
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,000
let's go to, what is it?

560
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Mount C user brand documents git.

561
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,360
And this is gonna be inside of Protobuf.

562
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:06,640
And then if we go inside of this folder,

563
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,640
so cd to source, cd to Google, cd to Protobuf.

564
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,560
So here we are inside of Protobuf

565
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,920
and we're gonna do a little experiment here

566
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,760
if I type it right.

567
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,760
So we're gonna find dot, we're gonna do a reg x.

568
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,000
I have this written down because I am not,

569
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,720
you know, the most incredible person

570
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:37,720
at remembering all these Unix or Linux commands.

571
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,600
One of the beautiful things about Linux

572
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,360
is that programs do a single thing and they do it well.

573
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,360
I love that.

574
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:49,040
That's the best design decision anyone could have.

575
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,400
In fact, I think I can, let me copy.

576
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,960
I think I can just copy this text

577
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,840
and paste it into the terminal here.

578
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,600
I know I can.

579
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,960
Whoop, it looks like I got a weird binary thing

580
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,800
at the beginning there.

581
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,000
Let me see if it's because the way I copied it.

582
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,440
No, here, let's just go to, nope.

583
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,440
You can't see it off screen,

584
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:19,440
but I have this inside of a little word or something.

585
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,080
Okay, f, there we go.

586
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,520
So I'm gonna do this reg x to just get all the headers,

587
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,160
cc, cfiles, and cpp files,

588
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,160
because this is a C++ repository.

589
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,840
I'm gonna do print zero instead of print

590
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,760
so that I can do x arg zero.

591
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,440
I'm gonna do basically a line count.

592
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,720
I'm gonna count the lines in this project.

593
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,080
So just to serialize bytes in one language

594
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,740
is over a quarter million lines of code.

595
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:55,480
And I don't know if some of those lines

596
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,680
are comments or whatever,

597
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,760
but this, I've written a game engine

598
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,280
that uses Vulkan and all in C.

599
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,760
So I've gotta do the Vulkan library in C,

600
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,160
and then it works with entities,

601
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:12,160
and it has all the transformations,

602
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,440
all that sort of stuff, including the shaders,

603
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,680
and it's less lines of code than this,

604
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,440
and it has tons of comments too.

605
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,720
So over a quarter million lines of code

606
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,680
is a lot of code for serializing some bytes.

607
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,240
And that's kind of where I'm coming from on this.

608
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,600
And if we go to the wrappers,

609
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,600
hopefully they're not as big.

610
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,040
Let's take a look at, let's say C sharp.

611
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,880
There's a lot of batch files in here.

612
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,240
Keys, vtest, okay, here we go, source.

613
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:49,240
Okay, so C sharp, source, and then of course we've got,

614
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,280
what are all these, tests?

615
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,720
Eh, let's just do the whole thing.

616
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,560
Life is short.

617
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:04,240
So this is much easier, we can just do CS files.

618
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:11,120
So this one alone is 142,139.

619
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,360
And this is a wrapper to like call.

620
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,040
I don't know if they re-implemented the code in C sharp,

621
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,640
or if they're calling the C++ code here.

622
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,600
Not a percent sure.

623
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:24,600
But still, it's a lot of code to write some bytes.

624
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,760
So that's kind of my perspective on big companies.

625
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,780
Their code bases, libraries.

626
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,320
I thought this is a nice simple way

627
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,920
to start off whatever series I'm doing here.

628
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,320
It's just talk about some code, I like code.

629
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,840
And I'm not, like I said, I'm not complaining

630
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,920
about all this, it all functions, I've used it.

631
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,560
It makes things a lot easier.

632
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,400
Companies should use them rather than rolling their own

633
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,480
because most likely you're gonna make a mistake

634
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,560
if you roll your own.

635
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,240
And you gotta deal with all that debugging and stuff.

636
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,560
I'm just putting out a hypothesis,

637
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,400
hypotheses or ideas here about how much power is wasted

638
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,400
and kind of how programmers polish rocks.

639
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,920
And I polish rocks all the time.

640
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,080
So yeah, and I think that's,

641
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,880
yeah, that's all I got for my view

642
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:37,240
on just coding, programming, third party libraries.

643
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:42,240
I don't know exactly what I'm gonna go over

644
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,440
in kind of future, what are these,

645
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,360
future podcasts I guess these are.

646
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,040
Not 100% sure what I'm gonna go over.

647
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,080
I can go over assembly for Game Boy games,

648
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,040
I can kind of dive into other people's code,

649
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,680
I can just talk about games in general and game design.

650
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,040
I have a lot of ideas or thoughts on game design.

651
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,280
And I'm trying not to ramble on them here.

652
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,280
And I've got lots of thoughts

653
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,240
of how we connect software together

654
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:18,240
from straight from the hardware in the C and C++ area

655
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:23,440
or whatever low level language that you use

656
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,680
or like all the way up to how it communicates

657
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,800
with a web server.

658
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,280
Yeah, I think that there's just a lot to think about,

659
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,440
a lot to talk about.

660
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,280
A lot to talk about and a lot to have fun with.

661
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,680
So this is like the first episode of this podcast

662
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,600
and I don't know how many people are gonna watch it

663
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,560
or people are even gonna see it.

664
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:52,560
But if you guys do exist, feel free to like throw out

665
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,200
some ideas of what to talk about

666
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,400
because like I said, it doesn't have to be just about code.

667
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,160
I love code, I could talk about code all day.

668
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,600
And it's been like 40 minutes,

669
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,960
I didn't even notice this time flew by.

670
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,120
But I could talk about games and game design, old games,

671
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,840
collecting games, I collect a lot of games.

00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,480
I could talk about art, art as it relates to programming

673
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,120
or games or just art in general, I like to draw.

674
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,800
So I have a lot of thoughts on that sort of stuff.

675
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,680
So yeah, it'd be really interesting to see

676
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,080
if anybody has some ideas of what to look over.

677
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:31,080
I thought this was a lot of fun.

678
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,440
I like talking about code, this is awesome.

679
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:58,440
Anyways, see you guys.
